When we talk about service at Salesforce, we’re talking about Service Cloud—a powerful platform of tools and processes to help you help your customers. With Service Cloud, you can deliver instant, personalized service and support to your customers. And because every company and its customers are different, you can customize Service Cloud to fit your needs. When your customers are happy, you're happy! So how exactly does Service Cloud work? You can let your customers communicate with you on any channel—email, phone, messaging apps, Experience Cloud sites, chat, text, and more. We transform those communications into cases, which represent a customer issue, request, or support ticket. Then you route those cases to service agents—the employees at your company who respond and resolve customer issues. Service Cloud is with you from start to finish, delivering an integrated and streamlined process for handling your customer support needs. Here’s an example of Service Cloud at work. Your customer has an issue with one of your products. They send you an email, and in Salesforce a case is created to track the problem. The case is viewed in the Service Console by one of your agents. After your agent find a resolution, they email your customer back.

Setting Description Default Case Owner Automatically assign a user or queue to all cases that don't match any case assignment rule entries. This user must be Active . Notify Default Case Owner Notify the default case owner when a case is assigned to that user. If the new owner is a queue, the notification is sent to the queue email address. Notifications are system-generated and can't be modified. Record Type Setting Indicates which record type to assign to cases created by users applying assignment rules. Select either: Keep the existing record type if you want new cases to keep the creator's record type Override the existing record type with the assignee's default record type if you want to overwrite the creator's record type on new cases Automated Case User Specify the user you want listed in the case feed items and Case History related list for automated case changes. The name of the automated case user is displayed in the From field in emails sent by an auto-response rule. Automated case changes can occur from assignment rules, auto-response rules, escalation rules, On-Demand Email-to-Case, or cases logged in the Self-Service portal. Select either: System to indicate that an automated process performed an action, such as creating a case or changing a case’s status. When you select System, the lookup field is unavailable. User to use the lookup field to specify a user, such as an administrator, to be the Automated Case User. This user must have the System Administrator profile or the Modify All Data and Send Email permissions. The user must have a verified email address to be an Automated Case User . Case Creation Template Specify the template used to notify contacts when a support agent manually creates a case. The notification is optional; it's triggered by a checkbox on the case edit page. This template must be Available for Use . In Lightning Experience, to display the send notification checkbox to users, you must: Specify a case creation template for this setting Edit the case page layout properties and select Show on edit page for the Email Notification Checkbox setting Case Assigned Template Specify the template used to notify users that a case was manually assigned to them by an administrator or another user. The notification is optional; it's triggered by a checkbox on the Change Case Owner page. This template must be Available for Use .Case Assigned templates aren’t configurable for Experience Cloud site users. Case Close Template Specify the template used to notify contacts that a case has been closed. The notification is optional; it's triggered by a checkbox on the Close Case page. This template must be Available for Use . Note Case Close Template is available in Aloha as of Summer '21 so Salesforce doesn't auto-assign it. Customer Feedback Survey Specify a survey to send to the case contact when the case is closed. Enable Surveys before specifying a survey. By default, the Customer Satisfaction survey is set. New Cases Visible in Portal Automatically selects the Visible in Self-Service Portal checkbox for all new cases, including cases created via Web-to-Case, Email-to-Case, and On-Demand Email-to-Case. Regardless of this default, users creating cases can manually set the Visible in Self-Service Portal checkbox. If you’re using Digital Experiences, this setting doesn’t apply for partner or customer users viewing cases in Experience Builder sites. New case visibility in Experience Builder sites is controlled by sharing rules. Enable Case Comment Notification to Contacts Notify contacts when a case comment has been modified or added to a case. If you select this setting, click Case Comment Template and choose the email template to use for these notifications. This template must be Available for Use . Emails can’t be sent to contacts that are Self-Service portal users. Notify Case Owner of New Case Comments Notify the case owner when a user adds a public or private comment to a case. If you select this setting, case owners can't opt out of receiving these notices. Notices aren't sent to inactive case owners. In Lightning Experience, email notifications aren’t sent when agents use in-line edit on the case record detail page to update the Internal Comments field. Early Triggers Enabled Enable early triggers for escalation rules and their actions. You can set up an escalation rule to perform an action when a case has been unresolved for a specific number of hours. The Age Over hour you specify determines when Salesforce performs the escalation action. Enable early triggers to ensure that your escalation actions are triggered before the Age Over hour you specify. Enable Suggested Solutions Enable the Suggested Solutions button on case detail pages so agents can propose specific solutions to help resolve cases. Enable Suggested Articles Provide suggested articles on the Articles related list. You can make suggested articles available in all Salesforce Knowledge channels except the public knowledge base. Send Case Notifications from System Address Use a system email address rather than the user who updated the case’s for notifications, case comments, attachments, and assignments. System notifications use noreply@salesforce.com as the From email address only if no default No-Reply email address is set. Note When notifying a Case Contact after creating a public comment, the From field will take the email from the commenter. This setting helps prevent Self-Service or Customer Portal users who update their cases from receiving out-of-office emails from case owners. Notify Case Owners when Case Ownership Changes Automatically select the Send Notification Email checkbox on cases when users change a case owner to another user. This setting helps prevent users from forgetting to notify other users that they're the new owner of a case. Agents can still select the send notification checkbox even if you don’t enable this setting. In Salesforce Classic, selecting this option doesn't automatically select Send Notification Email when users change a case owner to a queue. However, in Lightning Experience, if you select this option, the checkbox is always automatically selected for user and queue changes. Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field Add closed statuses to the Status field on cases. Agents can close cases without having to click the Close Case button and update information on close case page layouts. Selecting Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field doesn't remove the Close button from case list views. Instead, it adds Closed to the list of statuses available for users to choose from when they select multiple cases and click Change Status on case list views. Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field is supported for standard Case Detail, standard Case list views, and standard Related Record components connected to a Case quick action. Custom record Detail, custom components, and custom quick actions aren’t supported by this feature in Lightning Experience. Standard quick actions are also not supported by this feature in the Publisher and Highlight panel. Hide Save & Close Button and Cls Links After selecting Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field , you can select this checkbox so that the Save & Close button on case edits pages and the Cls links on Cases related lists don't display unnecessarily. Instead, users close cases via the Status field and Save button. Enable Case Feed Actions and Feed Items Enables case feed-specific actions and feed items. When you select this option, existing cases are upgraded to the case feed user interface. Size of Email Feed Item Body Control the size of email feed items by setting a character limit on the email feed item body. You can set the character limit to: Small: 400 characters (default) Medium: 1200 characters Large: 5000 characters Custom: A value from 400 through 5000 characters If an email feed item body exceeds the character limit, users can click More to see the rest of the email feed item body. Blank Lines in Email Feed Item Body Save space in the case feed by removing blank lines in the body of email feed items. Collapse Previous Emails in Email Feed Item Body (Salesforce Classic Console App) In a Salesforce Classic console app, display only the most recent email in the email feed item body. Users can click More to see previous emails in the thread. Agents can also collapse expanded email threads by refreshing the browser. This setting applies only to console apps in Salesforce Classic. Enable Default Email Templates or the Default Handler for Email Action Use an Apex class to load a default email template or to specify the default target fields for the email action on cases. Enable Email Drafts Enables email draft functionality. If email drafts are enabled, the popout to docked email composer action in the toolbar is disabled. Enable Question-to-Case in Salesforce Let moderators create cases from Chatter questions in your organization. Create Auto-Response Record After Customer’s First Email Changes the order of case feed items and records, so that feed items that are automatically generated appear after the customer’s first email.

By default, business hours are set 24 hours, seven days a week in the default time zone specified in your organization's profile. Additionally, users with the “Customize Application” permission can add business hours to escalation rules so that when the details of a case match the criteria of an escalation rule, the case is automatically updated and escalated with the times and location on the rule. For example, a case updated with Los Angeles business hours escalates only when a support team in Los Angeles is available. To set business hours: From Setup, enter Business Hours in the Quick Find box, then select Business Hours . Click New Business Hours . Type a name for the business hours. We recommend using a name that will remind users of a location or time zone when they view business hours on a case, entitlement process, or milestone. For example, if your business hours are for a support center in San Francisco, you could use the name San Francisco Business Hours . Click Active to allow users to associate the business hours with cases, escalation rules, milestones, and entitlement processes. Optionally, click Use these business hours as the default to set the business hours as the default business hours on all new cases. Default business hours on cases can be updated with business hours on escalation rules if the cases match escalation rule criteria and the rule is set to override business hours. Choose a time zone to associate with the business hours in the Time Zone drop-down list. Set your business hours for each day of the week. If your support team is available during the entire day every day of the week, select the 24 hours checkbox. Choose the start and end times for the business hours. If the time you want isn’t available, click the field and type it in. Leave the business hours start and end times blank and the 24 hours checkbox deselected to indicate that the support team is not available at all that day. Click Save . After you have set business hours, you can associate them with: Escalation rules, so that when the details of a case match the criteria of an escalation rule, the case is updated and escalated with the business hours on the rule. Holidays, so that business hours and any escalation rules associated with business hours are suspended during the dates and times specified in holidays. Milestones, in entitlement processes so that business hours can change with the severity of a case. Entitlement processes, so that you can use the same entitlement process for cases with different business hours. Note All users, even those without the “View Setup and Configuration” user permission, can view business hours via the API.

There are a few guidelines to keep in mind as you set business hours. Available in: Salesforce Classic Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Entitlements and milestones available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud After you set business hours, add the Business Hours lookup field to case layouts and set field-level security on the Business Hours field. This lets users view and update the business hours on a case. Business hours on a case are automatically set to your organization's default business hours, unless the case matches the criteria on an escalation rule associated with different business hours. Salesforce automatically calculates daylight savings times for the time zones available for business hours, so you don’t have to configure rules to account for time zones. Business hours on a case include hours, minutes, and seconds. However, if business hours are less than 24 hours, the system ignores the seconds for the last minute before business hours end. For example, suppose it is 4:30 PM now, and business hours end at 5:00 PM. If you have a milestone with a 30-minute target, it’s more common to say that the target is 5:00 PM, not 4:59 PM. To accommodate this, the system stops counting seconds after 5:00. If seconds were counted from 5:00:00-5:00:59, the 30-minute target would occur after the 5:00:00 PM target cut-off and would roll over to the next day. Escalation rules only run during the business hours they’re associated with. You can update cases associated with business hours that are no longer active. without having to reactivate business hours. You can’t include the Business Hours field in list views or reports. You can create multiple business hours for support teams that operate in the same time zone but at different hours. For simplicity, we recommend that you create one set of business hours per support center. You can’t deactivate business hours that are included in escalation rules. You must first remove them from the escalation rules. You can associate up to 1000 holidays with each set of business hours. On cases that include entitlements, business hours are applied according to a hierarchy. For details, see How Business Hours Work in Entitlement Management . Note All users, even those without the “View Setup and Configuration” user permission, can view business hours via the API. See Also Set Business Hours Set Up Support Holidays Loading "

In Business Hours setup, you can use Create New Holiday to define a custom holiday. After you save the custom holiday, the Holidays page is displayed in the Salesforce Classic layout. When you close the page, you will return to the Salesforce Lightning interface. Holidays automatically acquire the time zone of the business hours with which they are associated. For example if you associate a holiday to business hours that are in Pacific Standard Time, the holiday will take effect for those business hours in Pacific Standard Time You can only add business hours marked as Active to holidays. Holiday names don’t need to be unique. For example, you could create multiple holidays named New Year's Day . Currently, report results do not take holidays into account. If you schedule a holiday to recur on a specific day of every month, the holiday will only recur on months that have that specific day. For example, if you schedule a holiday on the 31st day of every month, then the holiday will only recur on months that have 31 days. If you want a holiday to recur on the last day of every month, choose last from the On day of every month drop-down list.

To use the articles tool, set up Salesforce Knowledge. Review how cases are upgraded and know what to expect when you enable Case Feed actions and feed items. When you’re ready, enable Case Feed actions and feed items . Note In organizations created before Winter ‘14, you also need to: Enable Chatter and actions in the publisher. Enable feed tracking on cases. On the feed tracking page, turn off tracking for the Status field. Turning off tracking for the Status field prevents duplicate feed items when agents update a case’s status using the Change Status action. Customizing Page Layouts Choose what you want to appear on Case Feed page layouts based on your company’s needs and how your support agents work. Create layouts for case detail and close case pages and highlights panels . Create layouts for feed view pages to specify which actions, fields, and tools agents see when they’re working with cases. Giving Users Access The easiest way to give users access to Case Feed is to assign them to profiles that use the feed-based case page layouts you create. In organizations created before Spring ’14, you can also give users access in these ways. By creating permission sets and assigning them to users Through custom profiles Setting Up Case Feed: Adding More Functionality Follow these optional steps to add more functionality to Case Feed. To let agents include short, pre-written messages in their emails, set up quick text and create quick text messages. To give agents the option of emailing customers to let them know when questions they've posted to a portal have been answered, enable portal email notifications. To allow agents to save email messages as drafts before sending them, and to make it possible to create approval actions for email, enable email drafts. To help agents save time and increase consistency when sending emails to customers, create text, HTML, or Visualforce email templates. To let agents automate repetitive tasks, add the macros browser to the console and give agents permission to use macros. To give agents access to more functionality, create and add custom actions. "

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions During the upgrade process, users don't notice anything different. After the process is complete, users for whom you've enabled Case Feed see existing and new cases in the new interface, while users without Case Feed continue to see traditional cases. Here’s what happens when cases are upgraded to the new interface: The 5000 most recent, active cases in your organization are converted to the Case Feed interface. The case conversion process varies depending on the number of cases being converted and the complexity of the data they contain. For example, cases with multiple email messages or other attachments can take longer to convert than other cases. Older cases are also upgraded if they have comments, emails, or logged calls that were added to the case within the date range that applies to the original 5000 converted cases. You can have up to 500 cases with current comments, up to 500 with current emails, and up to 500 with current logged calls for a total of 1500 additional converted cases. The following items are added to the feed for each case: Up to 60 email messages. Up to 60 private and public comments. These comments are converted to Chatter posts during the upgrade. Up to 60 logged calls. Some logged calls that were created before you upgraded to Case Feed can appear in the feed as tasks. The Case Feed interface is enabled for all new cases, giving users access to the publisher and feed. The Case Detail view becomes available, and contains additional information about the case, including items that remain in their current related lists. You receive an email message when the upgrade process has finished. Best Practices For the smoothest upgrade experience, we recommend enabling Case Feed in a full-copy sandbox organization before you enable it in your production organization. Enabling Case Feed in a full-copy sandbox org helps you determine how long the case conversion process takes and lets you review some sample cases in the new user interface. After you enable Case Feed in your production organization, wait until the upgrade process has finished to give users access. We recommend first assigning Case Feed to a single user, who can review some of the converted cases to be sure the upgrade process was successful, and then making it available to other users.

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can customize different parts of the case page layout in Case Feed. Highlights panels, which appear at the top of both feeds and case detail pages. The highlights panel shows key information about a case so that the most important information is immediately visible to agents. Feed views, which agents see when managing and interacting with cases. The feed view shows the case history using a Chatter-like feed, so that agents can see what’s happened in a case in context. Detail views, which agents see when they click View Case Details . The detail view shows useful information about the case, such as a description of the contact’s company, the account’s address, and related lists. You can also customize the close case page layout in Case Feed. Close case pages, which appear when agents close cases. The close case page lets agents enter information about the case resolution. From the object management settings for cases, you can create, edit, and assign all four types of layouts by going to Page Layouts. Convert Page Layouts for Case Feed Users to Case Page Layouts As of Spring '14, we've made creating and customizing case layouts easier by replacing page layouts for Case Feed users with feed-based layouts for case pages. By converting your older page layouts, you can use the advanced page layout editor to manage them and can assign Case Feed to users more easily.

Feed-based case layouts include the same features as page layouts for Case Feed users: a feed, which includes a publisher with actions, feed filters, tools such as an articles tool, and sidebar components such as custom buttons and links; a highlights panel; and a detail page, with related lists and other in-depth information about the case. You can use the standard page layout assignment tool to assign feed-based case page layouts to users. You no longer have to use permission sets or custom profiles to give users access to Case Feed. To convert page layouts for Case Feed users to feed-based case layouts: From the object management settings for cases, go to Page Layouts. Click next to a layout in the Page Layouts for Case Feed Users list and choose Convert to case page layout . We recommend using this option so you can review the converted layout before you delete the original, but to save time, you can choose Convert to page layout and delete . The converted layout appears in the Case Page Layouts list with the prefix Converted:. Click Edit next to it. In the page layout editor, confirm that the layout includes the elements you want. To see and edit what's included in the feed view, including feed filters and sidebar components, click Feed View . When you're happy with the case page layout, click Page Layout Assignment in the Case Page Layouts list to assign it to the appropriate user profiles. Note For custom profiles with the Use Case Feed permission, or profiles with permission sets that include Use Case Feed , these page assignments don't take effect until you remove the permission or permission set. If your organization was created between Winter '14 and Spring '14, you can't remove Use Case Feed from standard profiles, so these assignments don't take effect until you delete all of your page layouts for Case Feed users. Click next to the older version of the layout in the Page Layouts for Case Feed Users list and choose Delete . In the confirmation that appears, click OK . If there are users assigned to the layout you delete, you're prompted to choose another layout as a replacement. This prompt is only a formality: When you assign users to a case page layout, that's what they see. If you have multiple layouts for Case Feed users, we recommend converting and deleting them all at the same time. When you delete the last of your older layouts, the Page Layouts for Case Feed Users list disappears.

The actions list looks more like the Chatter publisher on other pages. The standard Chatter actions—Post, File, Link, Poll, Question, and Thanks—automatically appear in the publisher layout, and they replace the Write Case Note action. You can change the sequence of these actions and remove any you don’t need. The Feed View/Details dropdown list replaces the View Case Detail action. Custom actions you previously added to the Case Feed publisher aren’t available. Create custom actions and add them to the publisher. These new actions must use publisher.js rather than interaction.js . The Case Detail page expands to full width, making it easier to see all of your related lists and other information.

From Setup, click the Object Manager tab. Select Cases , and open the Buttons, Links, and Actions setup page. Click New Action . For Action Type, select Send Email . For Standard Label Type field, select a label for this action. When you add the action to the case page layout, this label is displayed in the actions bar. The Name field is auto-filled. This name is used in the API and managed packages. It must begin with a letter and use only alphanumeric characters and underscores, and it can’t end with an underscore or have two consecutive underscores. Unless you’re familiar with working with the API, we suggest not editing this field. In the Description field, describe what this quick action does. The description appears on the detail page for the action and in the list on the Buttons, Links, and Actions page. The description isn’t visible to your users. If you’re creating several actions on the same object, we recommend using a detailed description. Click Save . Note The email layout page opens, where you can specify the fields shown in the email action. Arrange the email fields in the order that you want. When an agent selects the quick action, the email fields are displayed in this order. From the Email Message Fields menu, drag fields into the email layout. To remove fields, drag them from the email layout to the Email Message Fields section. Note The To Address, From picklist, Subject, and HTML Body fields are added by default. To make a field read-only or required, hover over the field and then click and specify the field properties. To save the field properties, click OK . Click Save . To ensure that emails are associated with Salesforce records, create predefined field values for the To Recipients, CC Recipients, and BCC Recipients fields. Important In new orgs, when you enable Email-to-Case, we automatically configure the To Recipients predefined field value for you, so you can skip this step. However, if your org was created before Winter ’18, or if you enabled Email-to-Case before Winter ’18, complete the following steps to create predefined field values. We recommend that you define a value for the To Recipients field. The case email action provides a predefined field value (the case contact’s email address) for the To field. Emails aren’t associated with the Salesforce case contact record because this predefined field type is Text (a plain email address with no link to the case contact). To change the default experience and associate emails with Salesforce records, you must create predefined field values. The predefined field values for the To Recipients, CC Recipients, and BCC Recipients fields are filled only for the initial email. The fields aren’t pre-filled for reply emails or forwarded emails. In the Predefined Field Values section, click New . For Field Name, select one of these fields. To Recipients CC Recipients BCC Recipients Use the formula editor to associate your selected field with a Salesforce record using the JUNCTIONIDLIST function. Note For values with only one ID, you don’t have to use the JUNCTIONIDLIST function. For example: To associate the To Recipients field with the case’s contact record, enter: JUNCTIONIDLIST(Case.ContactId) OR Case.ContactId To associate the BCC Recipients field with the case’s owner and the owner’s manager, enter: JUNCTIONIDLIST(Case.OwnerId, Case.Owner:User.ManagerId) Click Save . After you define the quick action, add it to the case page layout so it’s available for agents to use. Note Send Email quick actions are not available on cases in Experience Builder sites. To automatically save emails your agents are working on, enable email drafts. Apply a Default Email Template Using the Send Email Quick Action Help agents incorporate branding and ensure consistency when writing emails to customers in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app by using default email templates. Email templates help ensure that agents include common information, such as greetings, announcements, disclaimers, and company contact information, in customer emails. Fields Available on the Send Email Quick Action for Cases After you create an Email quick action for cases, you can customize the fields displayed for the action. Drag fields from the Email Message Fields palette to the email layout. Send Email Action Considerations for Cases Before working with the Send Email action for cases, be aware of these limitations.

Before creating a Send Email quick action that specifies a default email template, create an email template of the type Custom. Only Custom type templates are supported. Attachments specified on an email template aren’t supported. However, agents can manually add attachments when they use the email quick action. Create a Send Email quick action or modify an existing Send Email quick action. From Setup, enter “Case” in the Quick Find box, then select Buttons, Links, and Actions . Click New Action , or select the quick action that you want to change. In the Action Type picklist, select Send Email . In the Default Email Template field, click the lookup button and select a template. Only email templates of the type Custom are shown in the lookup menu. Optionally, select Don’t Apply Template Subject to ignore the email template subject. By default, the Send Email quick action applies the subject specified in the default email template. For example, if the template’s subject line is “Thanks for your email,” then that subject is applied when the agent uses the email action to write an email. If Don’t Apply Template Subject is selected, then the subject defined in the email template isn’t applied to the email. In a reply, to use the default template but keep the customer's subject line, select reply and discard the draft. If Don’t Apply Template Subject is selected, the template's subject isn’t applied. For example, if a customer sends an email with the subject “Please help,” the agent discards the draft reply to use the email template and keep the customer’s subject line. Specify a label for the action. You can use a standard label type, which supplies a default label, or you can select None in the Standard Label Type field, and specify your own label. When you add the action to the case page layout, this label is displayed in the actions bar. The Name field is automatically populated. This name is used in the API and managed packages. It must begin with a letter and use only alphanumeric characters and underscores, and it can’t end with an underscore or have two consecutive underscores. Unless you’re familiar with working with the API, we suggest not editing this field. In the Description field, describe what this quick action does. The description appears on the detail page for the action and in the list on the Buttons, Links, and Actions page. The description isn’t visible to your users. If you’re creating several actions on the same object, we recommend using a detailed description, such as “Send Email to Customer with Holiday Branding.” Click Save . The email layout page opens, where you can specify the fields shown in the email action. Check that you have the appropriate email body field for your template. The HTML Body field is added to the Send Email quick action layout by default. If the Text Body format is needed, it’s available. Click Save .

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions As of Spring '17, the Lightning Email Composer has been replaced with a new Send Email action. The old Send Email action no longer displays to end users. It remains in existing page layouts, but isn’t in the page layout editor palette. If you remove the action from a page layout, you can’t add it back. Tip How do you tell the difference between the new and old Send Email actions? Hover your mouse over a Send Email action in the page layout editor palette. The new action has its Action Type listed as Quick Action. General You can’t add custom fields or rename existing fields in the Send Email action. The From field is required. If the From field isn’t on the Send Email action layout, it must have a predefined value set. HTML Body content is required; Text Body content is only supported on the case-specific Send Email action. If the HTML Body field isn’t on the Send Email action layout, it must have a predefined value set. Org-wide email addresses can’t be used with Salesforce Inbox. Customer community users in Experience Cloud sites can't send emails. The Related To field can’t be set to Cases in the global Send Email action. To see the Email tab in the activity composer, set Email Deliverability to All Email. For each email in the case feed, agents see a dropdown menu with reply options. If you have multiple email actions in the case feed publisher, agents see groups of reply actions in the dropdown menu. In email replies, merge fields in the body of the original email (the quoted content) are automatically modified to include spaces between brackets. This security measure prevents merge fields from resolving to field values. Cases Turn on Email-to-Case to enable the case-specific Send Email action on cases. Only the case-specific Send Email action can be added to cases. The Email Composer tab must be selected in the Feed for the Reply and Reply-All Email actions to work. You can’t send emails related to cases from the Global Actions menu. Predefined Values The To Address, CC Address, and BCC Address fields only accept email addresses as predefined values. Use string fields, such as Contact.custom_email_field . Note Emails sent with only email addresses specified aren’t associated with Salesforce records. The To Recipients, CC Recipients, and BCC Recipients fields accept a list of Salesforce Ids using the JUNCTIONIDLIST function. Use ID fields, such as Contact.Id . Emails sent with these predefined fields ensure that emails are associated with Salesforce records. For example, like the case’s contact record. You can use the To Recipients, CC Recipients, and BCC Recipients fields to send emails to multiple contacts and users. The fields work only with the email action for cases. When you click on the email composer tab, you Reply All to the latest email in the current case. When you Reply All, either by clicking on the email composer tab or by clicking Reply All on a specific email, Salesforce populates the CC field. If you’re replying to an inbound message, the CC field is based on that message’s To and CC values. This does not include Email-to-Case routing addresses or org-wide addresses. If you’re replying to an outbound message, the CC field is populated only if that outbound message has a CC field. These behaviors apply only to the Reply All action, not Reply. You can only predefine Related To for an entity-specific quick action, not a global quick action. The predefined field values for the To Recipients, CC Recipients, and BCC Recipients fields are filled only for the initial email. The fields aren’t pre-filled for reply emails or forwarded emails. Predefined values aren’t supported in emails initiated from the Assistant or Opportunity Insights. If Compliance BCC is enabled, predefined values for the BCC field are ignored. If Auto BCC is enabled, predefined values for the BCC field are appended to the Auto BCC address. If an admin removes the BCC field from the layout, Auto BCC doesn’t populate the user's email address in the email. An admin's configuration takes precedence over Auto BCC. If an admin specifies a predefined BCC value, the email is populated with the predefined value and not the Auto-BCC email address. "

Case hovers are enabled by default and appear whenever you hover over a case number, except in list views. For users who work with cases all day, these hovers can save valuable time. and User Permissions Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions User Permissions Needed To customize compact layouts: Customize Application To view compact layouts: View Setup and Configuration Case hovers work in all Lightning apps, including apps with standard navigation and console navigation. These hovers are specific to cases only and don’t work for any other objects. To make sure that your users get the most out of case hovers, you can edit the case’s compact layout to customize which fields appear in the hover. There are three sections in the case hover: title and top fields, description, and the latest update. Title and Fields The top section of the hover displays the same information that’s displayed in the case’s Highlights Panel in the case record home. Only the first five fields are displayed. The first field is displayed at the title of the hover. Note The Highlights Panel and the case hover use the same compact layout. When you customize the compact layout, you affect both the Highlights Panel and the case hover. To customize the title and fields displayed in the case hover, edit the case’s compact layout. From Setup, at the top of the page, select Object Manager . Select Case and then click Compact Layouts . You can create a new compact layout or edit the default layout. Add the fields that you want displayed in the hover. Keep in mind that the hover displays only the first five fields, and the first field becomes the title. We recommend using the Subject as the first field in your compact layout. Sort the fields by selecting them and clicking Up or Down . The order you assign to the fields determines the order in which they display. Save the layout. If you created a new layout, click Compact Layout Assignment to set the compact layout as the primary compact layout for the object. You can’t customize the description and latest update sections. Description Displays the case’s description. If a case doesn’t have a description, the hover doesn’t include this section. Latest Update The Latest Update section of the hover displays the latest post or the most recent activity on the case feed. The case feed’s sort order determines which one is displayed in the hover. Whenever you change the sort order in a case feed, the hover is updated too. However, case feed filters don’t affect what’s displayed in the case hover. For example, if you filter a case feed for emails, the case hover still shows the latest update even if it’s not an email. To make sure that your users see the same latest update in the hover and on the case record page, use the Chatter component in the Lightning App Builder when editing your page. If instead you use the Chatter Feed component and filter it to display only certain feed types, your users will see inconsistent updates when looking at the record page versus the hover. The Latest Update section can display only one post. All post types are supported. For example, if the latest post was a post from a social channel like Facebook, that’s what displays in the hover. Here’s what the default case hover looks like. "

Your customers can log their own cases from an Experience Cloud site, Customer Portal, Self-Service portal, or Chatter Answers. Note Starting with Spring ’12, the Self-Service portal isn’t available for new Salesforce orgs. Existing orgs continue to have access to the Self-Service portal. You can create cases manually from the Cases tab, the Cases related list, or, depending on your org’s settings, in the feed on record detail pages. If you have an answers site, you can escalate an unanswered or problematic question into a new case. You can create or update cases only for contacts that are eligible to receive customer support. For how to find out if a contact is eligible, or if a service contract includes an entitlement, see Verify Entitlements . To create a case: Use Search to find the individual’s account and then locate the contact in the Contacts related list. If the contact doesn’t exist, create a contact for that account. Click New in the Cases related list of the contact. If your org uses record types, you might be prompted to choose a Record Type when creating a case. Different record types can have different fields and different picklist values. Enter information for the case. When you enter or select a contact for the Contact Name field, the Account Name field defaults to the account associated with the contact when you save the case. To choose a different account for the Account Name field, Lightning users can click the X on the default account and enter the desired one in the search box. To associate the case with an asset in Classic: Click the Asset lookup icon. Initially, the asset lookup lists all assets for the selected contact. Enter search criteria and click Go! to refine this list. Select an asset from the assets listed to associate it with the case. If you do not find a matching asset, click New to create a asset from the lookup dialog and associate it with the new case. The New button displays if your org has enabled Quick Create and you have the “Create” permission on assets. To associate the new asset with a product, enter your product search criteria and click Go! or select a product from the list of matches. Click Skip if you do not want to associate the asset with a product. Enter the asset details and click Save . Click Save , or click Save & New to save the case and create another. Alternatively, click Save & Close to save and close the case immediately. This action sets the Closed When Created field on the case, which indicates that the case was closed during creation. If your org settings allow it, you can associate the case with another case by typing the case number of the parent in the Parent Case field. Alternatively, you can click the lookup icon to search for a case's case number. When a case is associated with a parent case, it signifies a relationship between cases. The relationship can be a grouping of similar cases for easy tracking, or a division of one case into multiple cases for various users to resolve. When viewing a case, Lightning users can create and associate a child case at any time by clicking New Child Case in the Feed tab . You can also set who sees the case and, depending on how your org is configured, you can: Prevent a case from appearing in the Self-Service portal by deselecting Visible in Self-Service Portal . Automatically send an email to the contact indicating that the case was created, select Send notification email to contact . Automatically assign the case using your org's active assignment rule by clicking Assign using active assignment rules . If Assign using active assignment rules is selected and no assignment rule criterion is met, the case is assigned to the Default Case Owner. If this setting isn’t active, you are assigned as the owner. If Assign using active assignment rules is selected by default and you deselect it, you override your org’s default assignment rules and you’re assigned as the owner. Note When you save a newly created case with an active assignment rule, the record type of the case can change, depending on how your admin configured assignment rules. If your org uses divisions, the division of a new case is automatically set to the division of the related contact. See Also Clone Cases Case Fields Solve Cases "

Cases that do not match the assignment rule criteria are automatically assigned to the Default Case Owner specified in the Support Settings. Using an Assignment Rule when Creating or Editing a Case In Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations, when creating or editing a case, you can check a box to assign the case automatically using your active case assignment rule.

If you want this checkbox to be selected by default, your administrator can modify the appropriate page layout. If necessary, your administrator can edit the page layout to hide the assignment checkbox but still force case assignment rules. Changing Ownership of Multiple Cases (administrators only) From any case list page, an administrator, or a user with the Manage Cases permission, can manually assign one or more cases to a single user or queue. In addition, when a case is related to an account, the administrator or user must have Read and Assign permissions on the account.

Make sure that the new owner has the “Read” permission on cases. The Change link displays only on the detail page, not the edit page. In Group, Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations, check the Send Notification Email box to automatically send an email to the new case owner. Creating a Case Manually (default assignment) When you create a case from the Cases tab, you are automatically listed as the case owner, unless the assignment rule checkbox is displayed and you select it to enable the assignment rule. If it’s selected by default, you can override the assignment rule and assign yourself as the owner by deselecting the checkbox. Note You can use case assignment rules in Experience Builder sites if your cases are created using the New button on top of the Record List component (when mapped to cases).

It includes case actions like creating case notes, logging calls, changing the case status, and communicating with customers in a Chatter feed. Case Feed displays important case events in chronological order, so it's easy to see the progress of each case. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Agents assigned to a Case Feed page layout see a page that looks similar to the page shown in the screenshot. Administrators can customize case page layouts, so your org’s page layout can look different. Highlights Panel (1)—Provides an overview of the most important information about a case, such as the contact information, case name, case description, status, priority, and case owner. Agents can use the column dividers to resize sections of the highlights panel so they can see more of the info that’s most relevant. Feed and Detail Views (2)—From the feed view, which includes the publisher and feed, agents can easily switch to the case detail view to see more in-depth information and work with related lists. Publisher (3)—Contains the actions agents use to work with cases, such as the Email, Case Note, and Change Status actions. Articles Tool (4)—Lets agents find Knowledge articles that can help them resolve cases, and then attach them to a case or email them to customers. Feed Filters (5)—Help agents quickly find specific information in the feed by limiting the feed items that appear. Feed (6)—Offers a chronological view of the case’s history. Feed items are created for: Case record creation Incoming and outgoing email related to the case Comments related to the case on a customer portal or Chatter Answers Calls logged about the case Changes to the case status Comments made on the case Links or files added to the case Milestone activity related to the case Case actions that result from workflow events New tasks and events related to the cases Follow Button and Followers List (7)—Let agents follow the case so they’re notified in Chatter of updates to it, and let them see other followers. Custom Buttons and Links (8)—Give agents access to more tools and functionality. Administrators can customize most aspects of Case Feed, including: Fields in the highlight panel Actions that appear and the fields they include Feed filters that are available and where on the page the list appears Width of the feed Availability of tools, custom buttons, and custom links, and where they appear on the page Here’s some more information about using the case feed. Use Actions to Work with Cases in Case Feed Case Feed actions make it easy for support agents to do tasks like send email, post to portals and Experience Cloud sites, log calls, change case status, and write case notes, all on the same page. Use Feed Filters in Case Feed Feed filters make it easy for support agents to see all updates of one type, such as all call logs or all email messages, when working with cases in Case Feed. By using filters, agents can find the information they need more quickly, without having to browse through each case event. Case Feed and Related Lists In the traditional case interface, support agents complete tasks such as logging calls and sending emails primarily by working with related lists. In Case Feed, agents can do several of these tasks directly in the feed. Find, Attach, and Email Articles with the Case Feed Articles Tool Knowledge articles can help you solve cases more quickly by providing in-depth troubleshooting steps and other detailed information. Use the articles tool in Case Feed to search for articles relevant to the case you're working with, attach articles to the case, and email them to customers. View and Edit Cases from the Case Detail Page in Case Feed Use the Case Detail page to see and update detailed information about a case and work with related lists. Post on Cases and Experience Cloud Site Questions with the Experience Action in the Case Feed The Experience action in the case feed is your default option for responding to customers on cases that originated from an Experience Cloud site or customer portal.

Here are some common Case Feed actions. Depending on how your administrator has set up your organization, you don’t see all of these actions. Use the Email action to respond to customers by email . In some organizations, the Email and Portal actions are combined in an Answer Customer action. The Log a Call action lets you create a record of the details of a phone call. Call logs are visible only to other users in your organization, not to customers. Note If you’re using a SoftPhone, completed calls and call notes are logged automatically in the case’s feed, as are interaction log entries whose Status is Completed. With the Portal action, you can post replies to a customer portal of Chatter Answers site. Use the Change Status action to escalate, close, or make other changes to the status of a case. The Question action lets you search for and create questions. The Post, File, and Link actions are the same ones you’re used to seeing in Chatter. Use the Post action to create case notes to share information about the case or get help from others in your organization. (Notes created with the Post action aren’t included in the Case Comments related list on the case detail page.) Add a PDF, photo, or other document to the case with the File action.

By using filters, agents can find the information they need more quickly, without having to browse through each case event. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When creating or editing feed layouts , administrators can specify which filters are available: Choosing only All Updates automatically shows all events on a case and hides the list of individual feed filters. Use this option if you want support agents to see the complete history of a case. Choosing only one type of feed filter automatically shows only case events of that type and hides the list of individual feed filters. For example, if you select only All Emails , the feed for each case shows the email messages related to the case but not case notes, portal replies, or other activities. This option is useful for agents who provide support primarily by one channel—phone, email, or portal—and who need to see case events only for that channel. Choosing more than one type of feed filter shows a list of available filters in the left sidebar of the Case Feed page or above the feed in the center of the page, with the first filter selected by default. For example, if you make the All Emails, Status Changes, and Portal Answers filters available, the feed for each case shows, by default, the email messages related to the case; users can click the other filters to see other types of case events. Use this option if your agents tend to provide support in one channel but also need to be able to see other types of case updates. In addition, administrators can specify how and where the list of feed filters appears: As a fixed list in the left column. As a floating list in the left column. With this option, the feed filters list remains visible as users scroll down the page. This option can be useful with long feeds, as it lets agents quickly filter case activities from anywhere on the page, without having to scroll to the top. As a dropdown list in the center column. As in-line links in the compact feed view. This option is available only for compact feed view. See Also Use Case Feed in Salesforce Classic "

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Note To email customers from the Service Console app in Lightning Experience, Email-to-Case must be enabled in your org. To get started, open a case in the console. In the case feed publisher section, click Email . You can insert merge fields, look up contacts, preview emails, clear emails, and more from the email publisher. You can also insert Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience email templates, attach files, and remove attachments if you change your mind. Here are some things to keep in mind when working with emails in Lightning Experience. Look up contacts To look up contact email addresses, click the lookup icon in the To, CC, or BCC field. In the email composer, you can filter contacts by account contacts and by your colleagues (internal users). To add contacts as email recipients, select the contacts and click Add . Don't see who you're looking for? You can search by name. Note that you can select email address pills by clicking on them, unless you are using Safari. Attachments To attach multiple files from your computer, drag the files to the body of the email. You can drag as many files as you want, but the files can’t be more than 2 GB. To attach files uploaded in Salesforce, use the attachment icon. Merge fields Merge fields resolve only on send and preview. The field appears as plain text when inserted into the publisher. Tip You can insert merge fields that aren't listed in the dialog box, such as merge fields for accounts or contacts. Enter them as plain text and use the preview button to review before sending. Email templates You can insert Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic templates. When you insert a template, the subject is replaced with the template’s subject. If you insert a responsive email template that includes an HTML <head>, <meta>, <title> , or <style> tag, the template overwrites the content in the email body. Don't worry – we display a confirmation message, so you know before anything is overwritten. Email drafts A working draft of your email is saved every few seconds when you compose, reply, or forward an email. You can leave it and return to it at any time. Note Email drafts are private and can’t be shared. You can have only one draft per case. If you’re working on a case with an auto-saved draft, you can’t write another email until that draft is sent or discarded. Your Salesforce admin must enable email drafts. Email status The email history shows replies sent by the Salesforce user, starting with the most recent reply. The message details include an email status. Email Status Description New An inbound email that hasn’t been read. Read An inbound email that has been read but not replied to. Sent An outbound email. Replied Any email that has been replied to. Replying to a sent email gives it a Replied status. The status of an email is Replied when it’s replied to directly. For example, if you send an outbound reply to an inbound email, its status is Replied. If you then send a subsequent outbound reply to the same inbound email but don’t reply directly to the first outbound reply, then the status of the first outbound reply is set to Sent. Preview emails Use preview to review an email and its merge fields before sending. Delete and clear emails The trash icon deletes the working draft and resets the fields to the original state. The behavior differs depending on whether email drafts are enabled. When email drafts aren’t enabled, this action clears the body, subject, and added recipients, reverting the email to its original state. When email drafts are enabled, it deletes the draft and then reverts. Pop-to-docked email composer Open the docked email composer, which appears on the side of the console, so that it's easier to view the case feed while replying to an email. You also can maximize the email composer from the docked composer to help you focus on writing. To open the docked composer, click the popout-to-docked view icon in the email composer toolbar. If your admin enabled email drafts, then the popout-to-docked view button is disabled. Docked email composer When you send an email using the docked email composer, only a partial page refresh occurs. Images Embed images into messages by copy and pasting, providing an image URL, and browsing for or uploading Salesforce Files. The behavior for each method is slightly different. Copy and paste—Supports all image file types. The image is added as an attachment and inline, and the inline image can be resized. Images in case emails have a maximum size of 1 MB. In other emails, the maximum is 5 MB. Microsoft Edge isn’t supported. Internet Explorer 11 or earlier doesn’t allow resizing images. Web URL—No maximum file size. The image is added inline and can be resized. The image isn’t added as an attachment, and it isn’t converted to a Salesforce File. The default description text for an image is set to “User uploaded image.” Browse or upload Salesforce File—Creates a Salesforce File from an uploaded file, or inserts an existing Salesforce File. The file size limit is based on the limits for Salesforce Files. The image can’t be resized from the message itself. The image is added as an attachment and inline. If a content version for a Salesforce File changes, messages that used an older version of the Salesforce File aren’t updated. Note When using the case email publisher in Lightning Experience, email attachments are included only when you forward messages, but not when you reply to messages. Tables To add a table to an email, click the table icon in the email composer’s actions menu and fill out the table settings. Then, add your content to the table. Use the email composer actions menu to style the contents or insert images in the table. To edit the table’s cell spacing, padding, and alignment, double left-click on a table border. Note The table action isn’t available in the Lightning email template editor. Tables can be copied and pasted into the email composer from other applications, but the styling can be affected. Depending on where you’re viewing a table in Salesforce, table borders can appear as a double or single line. Code Samples Insert a code snippet that retains the code formatting by clicking the code sample icon and pasting the code into the code window. Keep in mind that your Salesforce admin can customize the email experience for cases. See Create a Send Email Quick Action for Cases . See Also Merge Fields for Cases "

The total size of your email message, including images and text, can be no more than 12 MB. Note You need to use the rich text editor in the email publisher to embed images. You can't embed images in plain text messages. To attach files to an email, click Upload files to choose a file from your computer or Salesforce, or to use a file that's already attached to the case, or drag files to the attachments area at the bottom of the email publisher.

You could email the customer step-by-step instructions for troubleshooting the ice maker and include an image after each step, and could attach two documents: a PDF of the user manual for the fridge (a 2 MB file) and a list of maintenance tips to keep the fridge working well (a 10 KB file). When the customer receives the email, she sees: The images embedded in the body of the email message so she can refer to them one at a time as she works through the troubleshooting steps The user manual and list of maintenance tips as attachments to the message, as their total size is less than 3 MB If you also attached a troubleshooting video (a 2.5 MB file), all three of the attachments appear to the customer as links, as the total size of all attachments is greater than 3 MB.

To include case details and customize your email template, create a verified custom No-Reply address. Otherwise, when you turn on Send Case Notification from System Address, email notifications for incoming emails on existing cases, Case Comment, Case Escalation, and Case Assignment send from noreply@salesforce.com. Emails sent from noreply@salesforce.com can’t be customized for security reasons and don’t include case details or customer information. and User Permissions Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions User Permissions Needed To add an organization-wide address: Modify All Data Previously, with Send Case Notifications from System Address turned on, email notifications for Case Comment and Case Assignment automatically sent from noreply@salesforce.com and could be used with a custom template. For Case Escalation and when an existing case received emails, email notifications always sent from the Automated Case User, ignoring the Send Case Notifications from System Address preference. Now, when you select Send Case Notifications from System Address , case-related email notifications send from your org’s default No-Reply address. From Setup, in the Quick Find Box, enter Organization-Wide Addresses , and then select Organization-Wide Addresses . Under Default No-Reply Address, Click Add in the Organization-Wide Email Addresses for User Selection and Default No-Reply Use section. Enter a display name. This name is what customers see as the email’s Sender Name. Enter your No-Reply email address. Important Your No-Reply email address can only be used as a special purpose organization-wide email address and can’t be used as a user-selectable organization-wide email address. Tell Me More Select a purpose. User Selection Allow all users or users with designated profiles to choose this address as the From address when sending emails. Select the profiles that apply. Default No-Reply Address Case-related email notifications are sent from this address when the option Send Case Notifications from System Address is selected. User Selection and Default No-Reply Address All users can choose this address as the From address when sending emails. Also, case-related email notifications are sent from this address when the option Send Case Notifications from System Address is selected. Click Save . An email is sent to the organization-wide email address. Follow the steps in the email to verify your org’s default No-Reply address. Note Your org can have an unlimited number of unverified emails, but only one can be verified at a time. Verifying a new email address replaces and deletes the previously verified one, and is the only way to remove a verified email address. Having only one verified email ensures that after setting up your first email address, your org will always have a verified email on file. Considerations: noreply@salesforce.com is used only when there isn’t a default No-Reply email address set for your org. noreply@salesforce.com can’t be used with a custom email template and doesn’t contain any customizable content. The email subject and body are automatically set and can’t be changed. We removed the ability to send custom emails from noreply@salesforce.com for your security and to give you more flexibility to send customized emails from your company’s No-Reply email. There are six case-related scenarios that trigger an email notification: A case is assigned to a new owner and the owner is notified. A comment is left on a case and the owner is notified. A public comment is left on a case and the contact is notified. A case is escalated and the old case owner and selected user are notified. A case is auto-assigned and the default case owner is notified. An email is sent on a case and the case owner is notified. Loading "

Most of the merge fields for cases correspond directly with a case field. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience The available merge fields vary according to which Salesforce edition you have. To reference the contact or account associated with a case, use the relevant contact or account merge fields. In Lightning Experience, you can insert merge fields as plain text in the email publisher. Keep in mind that merge fields resolve only on preview and send. This table explains the more advanced merge fields that represent values derived from processing a case record. Field Merge Field Description Works in Lightning Experience Articles as PDFs Case.Articles_as_PDFs Articles associated with the case converted to PDF attachments. In the Emails related list on the case detail page, users can click Send an Email and choose a template containing this merge field. The attachments can be previewed or deleted before the email is sent. No Email Thread Case.Email_Thread A thread of all emails where the case contact is a sender or recipient (To, CC , or BCC ). The emails are listed in reverse chronological order so the most recent emails appear at the top of the thread. The thread inserts the text version of the emails. You can’t use this merge field in Visualforce pages. The limits for the email thread are: Maximum number of emails: 200 Email body truncation size: 32 KB Yes 1 Last Case Comment Case.Last_Case_Comment The description of the most recent comment to be created on a case. No Solution Attachments Case.Solution_Attachments Attachments for the case solution. No Solution Description Case.Solution_Description The details of the solution associated with the case. If more than one solution is associated with the case, the description of each solution appears in a list. Yes Solution Subject Case.Solution_Subject The title of the solution associated with the case. If more than one solution is associated with the case, the title of each solution appears in a list. Yes Solution Subject and Description Case.Solution_Subject_and_​Description The title and details of the solution associated with the case. If more than one solution is associated with the case, the title and description of each solution appears in a list. Yes Suggested Solutions Case.Suggested_Solutions Links to the subject and description of each suggested solution that can help customers solve their issues. Sending mass emails using templates with the suggested solutions merge field can take several minutes and isn’t recommended. No Case Thread Id Case.Thread_Id A unique identifier for the case email thread in Email-to-Case with Ref Id threading. If you are using Ref Id threading, Salesforce recommends that you transition to Lightning threading. The thread ID is a unique string, such as [ref:_DV0Txx._500V0U9YB:ref]. By default, it’s added to both the subject and body of case emails. In the body, the default location is at the end of the body. Use this merge field to position it elsewhere. Yes Case Thread Token Case.Thread_Token A unique identifier for the case email thread in Email-to-Case with Lightning threading. The thread token is a unique string in the case email, such as [thread::nYPXg5GyOvy0OZjpyhig6zw::]. It can be added to both the subject and body of case emails. In the body, the default location is at the end of the body. Use this merge field to position it elsewhere. Yes 2 Notes on Merge Fields for Cases Email Thread—This merge field works in Lightning Experience when inserted as plain text. However, it doesn’t work in email templates. Case Thread Token—This merge field is supported in Lightning Experience only. Merge fields for entitlements on cases—Merge fields for entitlements on cases aren't supported. For example, if you add the Entitlement Name {!Case.Entitlement} merge field to an email template, the field is not populated on the template. Merge fields for Email-to-Case or On-Demand Email-to-Case—If you have enabled Email-to-Case or On-Demand Email-to-Case, you can create email templates that support agents can use to respond to case emails. These templates can include merge fields that display information from the original email in the response. Merge fields for Web-to-Case—To reference the name, email, phone, or company of the customer who submitted an online case with Web-to-Case, use the relevant {!Case_OnlineCustomer...} field. Recipient merge fields—When using Lightning Experience templates and case automation, this merge field behaves differently than it does with Salesforce Classic templates. External users aren’t supported as recipients, and these users don’t receive emails. "

If you can see all fields in the original article, all fields also appear in the automatically generated PDF. If field-level security restricts you from seeing a field on an article, that field and its data do not appear in the article's PDF. If the Use a profile to create customer-ready article PDFs on cases checkbox is selected and a profile is chosen from the Profile menu (from Setup, enter Knowledge Settings in the Quick Find box, then select Knowledge Settings ), the chosen profile determines which fields appear in automatically generated PDFs. For example, if you are sending article PDFs to customers, you can choose the Customer Portal User profile to ensure that internal-only fields do not appear in article PDFs. Fields in the Properties section of an article, including First Published, Last Modified, Last Published, and Summary , are not included in any PDF version regardless of setting or profile. Loading "

If set up, select Assign using active assignment rules to reassign a case using an assignment rule. If the case doesn’t match rule criteria, it’s reassigned to your organization’s default case owner. If set up, click Sharing to share a case with other users, groups, or roles. If set up, close a case by selecting Closed under Status . Otherwise, click Close Case and change any fields as needed. If knowledge article submissions are set up, click Save and Create Article to store information that would help others close similar cases. When the draft article you submit is published, it’s attached to the case and available in the knowledge base for easy reference. If set up, a Web-to-Case Information section lists information entered by the customer who created the case from a website form. The Manage Cases app permission is required to edit, delete, transfer, and create cases, and contains the Edit Case, Delete Case, Transfer Cases, and Create Case permissions. If any of the individual permissions are removed from a profile or permission set, the Manage Cases app permission is disabled. Using Case Related Lists To reply and work with cases created from Email-to-Case, use the Emails related list. To view the required steps in a support process or to add the date of a completed milestone, use the Case Milestones related list. To add files to a case, drag them onto the Files or Attachments related list. You can only drag files in Lightning Experience. To find articles from your organization’s knowledge base to help solve a case, use the Articles related list. To initiate a search, type keywords. Attach relevant articles to the case to track solutions and help others solve similar cases. Attached articles appear on the related list. If you create a draft article while closing a case, the article appears on the related list after the draft article is published. To find solutions (version 1.0 of articles) to help solve a case, use the Solutions related list. If solution categories are set up, choose them to refine your search, along with keywords. If suggested solutions are set up, click View Suggested Solutions to see relevant solutions. The solutions are suggested based on relevancy and case similarity. Replying to Cases from Chatter Answers (Not Available in Lightning Experience) To reply to a case converted from a question on a web site, type your response in the Chatter-like feed, and click Answer Customer . Your response is tracked on the Case Comments related list. Case comments marked Public display as private messages from customer support in Chatter Answers. They don’t display to the entire site. For example, if a support agent adds a public case comment, it displays only to the case’s contact private messages in Chatter Answers. Support agents can read all private and public case comments.

Entitlement Management Setup Checklist When you set up entitlement management, you decide which features to use. Use this checklist to confirm that you’ve set up entitlement management in a way that fits your support processes. Entitlement Management Limits and Limitations These limits and limitations apply to entitlements and their related features. Entitlements Entitlements are units of customer support in Salesforce, such as “phone support” or “web support.” They’re typically used to represent terms in service agreements. Milestones Milestones represent required, time-dependent steps in your support process, like first response or case resolution times. Milestones are added to entitlement processes to ensure that agents resolve support records correctly and on time. Entitlement Processes Entitlement processes are timelines that include all the steps (or milestones) that your support team must complete to resolve support records like cases or work orders. Each process includes the logic necessary to determine how to enforce the correct service level for your customers. Service Contracts Service contracts in Salesforce represent a customer support agreement between you and your customers. You can use them to represent subscriptions, service level agreements (SLAs), and other types of customer support. Set Up Entitlement Management in Experiences Add entitlement management to your experiences to let customers or partners view their entitlements and service contracts. "

Before you begin the setup process, it’s essential to choose an entitlement management model. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Choose What Determines Support Eligibility You can set up entitlement management so customers are eligible for support based on one or several of the following types of records: Accounts: Any contact on the account is eligible for support. Contacts: Specific contacts are eligible for support. Assets: Specific assets (purchased products) are eligible for support. Service contracts: Customers are eligible for support based on a specific service contract. Contract line items: Specific products covered by a service contract are eligible for support. Your approach depends on how detailed you want your support process to be. If you prefer to keep it simple, just have your support agents determine support eligibility based on accounts. Here’s what this approach looks like: Choose a Setup Model There are three general ways to set up entitlement management. Once you’ve decided what should determine support eligibility, review the three models and select the one that best meets your business needs. You can always change which model you’re using. Entitlement model What determines support eligibility Use this model if Entitlements only (simplest option) Support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support at the account, contact, or asset level. There's no need to manage your customers' entitlements as part of a service contract Your entitlements don't have a renewal process Entitlements aren't purchased by your customers; they're bundled with products (warranties) Your customers' entitlements are short term and managed independently of each other Entitlements + service contracts Support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support based on their service contract. Entitlements are purchased and managed separately from the products they cover and are part of a service contract Your customers' entitlements are renewed at a contract level You use Salesforce for customer support but not necessarily for service contract management Entitlements + service contracts + contract line items (most complex option) Support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support based on the products covered in their service contract. You use Salesforce for customer support and to manage your customers' service contracts Your support team manages service contract transactions, such as transfers, mergers, and renewals Warranties, subscriptions, or other support products appear as line items on your sales orders and map to one or more entitlements Entitlements are created and updated through an integration with your order management system Regardless of the setup model you choose, you can enhance your support process with other entitlement management features. For example, you can: Create entitlement processes to enforce required, time-dependent steps in your support process Use entitlement versioning to create and maintain multiple versions of entitlement processes Add entitlements to experiences Report on entitlements After you select a setup model, head to the invaluable Entitlement Management Setup Checklist .

Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Limits Limit Details Maximum entitlement processes per org 1,000 Maximum milestones per entitlement process 10 Maximum service contracts in a service contract hierarchy 10,000 Maximum contract line items in a contract line item hierarchy 10,000 Limitations Experience Limitations Entitlements are only supported in experiences built using Salesforce Tabs + Visualforce and can’t be added to Lightning Experience. Entitlement Limitations Every entitlement must be associated with an account. You can’t share entitlements. Entitlements inherit their parent account’s sharing settings. To update an entitlement, you need Read access on the parent account. If you’re using entitlement processes, manage customers’ work orders and cases on separate entitlements. This is because an entitlement process only runs on records that match its type. For example, when a Case entitlement process is applied to an entitlement, the process only runs on cases associated with the entitlement. If a work order is also associated with the entitlement, the process won’t run on the work order. Merge fields for entitlements on cases aren't supported. For example, if you add the Entitlement Name {!Case.Entitlement} merge field to an email template, the field is not populated on the template. Entitlement contacts don’t have page layouts, search layouts, buttons, links, or record types. Entitlements don’t automatically apply to cases created with Web-to-Case or Email-to-Case. For details on how to auto-add entitlements to these types of cases, see Automatically Add Entitlements to Cases from Web, Email, and Experiences . An email violation is triggered to the Queue if there is an email address associated with it. Queue members don't receive the violation email. Milestone Limitations You can’t add milestones to support records without using entitlement processes. Entitlement processes apply milestones to support records. Milestones aren’t marked completed automatically. For details on how to auto-complete milestones on records that match unique criteria, see Auto-Complete Case Milestones . Actions on time-based milestones sometimes execute a few seconds before their target date. For example, if you set up a violation action to occur 0 minutes after the milestone is violated, the action can execute in the minute before the target date. After an entitlement process is activated, you can’t delete its milestones or create milestone actions. But you can create versions of entitlement processes with different milestone settings and apply the new version to existing entitlements. By default, the tracker shows only one milestone countdown at a time. To view upcoming milestones, use the links in the tracker. The Case Milestone Status field isn’t available in list views in Lightning Experience. The Milestone component and tracker doesn’t appear in the Salesforce mobile app. Business hours on entitlement processes aren’t supported in change sets. To transfer an entitlement process with business hours from one Salesforce org to another, use one of these approaches: Create the entitlement process from scratch in the new org. Use an alternative method to transfer the entitlement process, such as the Ant Migration Tool. Remove the business hours from the entitlement process before adding it to a change set. Case Milestone doesn't have system fields to identify who completes or changes the milestone. Service Contract Limitations You can only use contract line items if your org uses the Product object. You can’t create list views for contract line items. You can’t share contract line items. Contract line items inherit their parent service contract’s sharing settings. For example, users with the Read permission on service contracts inherit the Read permission on contract line items. In the Salesforce mobile app, contract line items can be edited and deleted but not created. You can’t select a record type when creating contract line items. To change a line item’s record type from the default type, manually update the record after it’s created. Note If you experience issues with the Root Service Contract field being blank, contact Salesforce for help. Lightning Experience Limitations The Entitlements related list isn’t available on contacts. The Entitlement Templates related list isn’t available on products. The Contacts related list isn’t available on entitlements. The Business Hours field isn't available on the Case Milestones related list. The Milestone Status Icon field on cases isn’t available. In the Object Milestones related list on work orders, only the following fields are supported: Created By, Created Date, Last Modified By, Last Modified Date, Deleted, Object Milestone ID, Object Milestone Name, Stopped Time (Mins), Elapsed Time (Mins), Target Date, Completion Date, and Parent Object. The Status Icon field on service contracts isn’t available. When you're adding multiple contract line items to a service contract, picklist fields on contract line items show all values in your org rather than only the values corresponding to the line item’s record type. But selecting a value corresponding to a different record type results in an error. This issue doesn’t occur when you edit a single line item. When you clone a case that’s related to an entitlement record, the Entitlement Process Start Time carries over from the cloned case.

Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud You can associate entitlements with accounts, assets, contacts, and service contracts. For example, a phone support entitlement can be added to an account. When a contact from that account calls your service department, support agents can quickly verify that they’re entitled to phone support. You can use entitlements on their own or as part of entitlement processes . Entitlement processes are timelines that contain all the steps that agents must complete to resolve a support record. To represent more complex service-level agreements in Salesforce—with features like renewal processes and multiple service levels—you can use service contracts and contract line items . View and manage entitlements in Salesforce from the Entitlements tab. Depending on how entitlements are set up, you can also use the Entitlements related list on accounts, contacts, assets, or service contracts. Note In Lightning Experience, the Entitlements related list isn’t available on Contacts. Set Up Entitlements Entitlements are units of customer support in Salesforce, such as “phone support” or “web support”. Set up entitlements in your Salesforce org to help support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support.

For example, you can create entitlement templates for web or phone support so agents can easily add entitlements to products offered to customers. Note In Lightning Experience, the contact related list isn’t available on Entitlements. Purchased or installed products are represented in Salesforce as assets. That means: A product (for example, “Laser Scanner”) is linked to an entitlement template A corresponding asset (for example, the laser scanner purchased by ABC Labs) is linked to an entitlement that was created from the entitlement template Note Entitlement templates are only available if entitlements and products are enabled in your org. Tip The Entitlement Management Trailhead module introduces you to common terms and walks you through the process of creating an entitlement template. And, it’s fun! To get started, see Entitlement Management . Add the Entitlement Templates related list to product page layouts. Optionally, add the Type and Business Hours fields to the Entitlement Templates related list. This lets users view the type of entitlement, such as Web or phone support, and any business hours that apply to the entitlement. Create an entitlement template. From Setup, enter Templates in the Quick Find box, then select Entitlement Templates . Click New Template . Enter any details: Field Description Entitlement Template Name The name of the entitlement template. Use a descriptive name, like Phone Support . This helps users better understand entitlement templates when they see them on related lists for products. Term (Days) The number of days the entitlement is in effect. For example, if you want the entitlement template to entitle all customers who purchase this product to 90 days of phone support, enter 90 . Entitlement Process The entitlement process associated with the entitlement. Per Incident Lets you limit the number of cases the entitlement supports. The admin determines whether this field is visible. Cases Per Entitlement The total number of cases the entitlement supports. This field is only available if Per Incident is selected. Business Hours The entitlement’s supported business hours. Type The type of entitlement, such as Web or phone support. Admins can customize this field’s values. Click Save . Add the entitlement template to a product. Go to the product detail page. Click Add Entitlement Template on the Entitlement Templates related list. Select the entitlement template. Click Insert Selected . Click Done . Now when a user creates an asset and links it to that product, the Entitlements related list on the asset includes an entitlement created from the entitlement template. That way, support agents responding to a call about the asset can quickly see what kind of support the customer is entitled to receive.

Learn how to perform common actions on entitlements. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Viewing Entitlements You can view entitlements on the Entitlements tab or the Entitlements related list on: Accounts Assets Contacts Note In Lightning Experience, the Entitlements related list isn’t available on Contacts. Service contracts To view entitlements that are associated with a particular account, contact, asset, or service contract, go to the Entitlements related list on the record. Tip Depending on how your Salesforce admin set up entitlements, your console app can include the Entitlements tab. In the console, you can view and edit entitlements and their associated records in one place. Creating Entitlements You can create and edit entitlements from the Entitlements tab or the Entitlements related list on accounts, assets, or service contracts. Your business can have its own processes for how to link entitlements to customers in Salesforce. The simplest approach is to create an entitlement on the customer’s account via the Entitlements related list. Then, use the entitlement for every contact on the account. Keep in mind that when you create a contact on an account, the contact doesn’t automatically inherit an entitlement from the account. Your admin can set up automation that creates an entitlement for new contacts on an account. Note You can add existing entitlements to contacts or products, but you can’t create entitlements from a contact or product record. Click Clone on an entitlement to quickly create an entitlement from an existing one. Deleting Entitlements You can delete entitlements on the entitlement’s detail page, the Entitlements related list, or the Entitlements tab. Deleting an entitlement moves it to the Recycle Bin. Any notes, attachments, or activities associated with the entitlement are also deleted. If you undelete the entitlement, the associated items are undeleted. Note You can’t delete an entitlement that’s associated with a case or work order. If a roll-up summary field has been added to the Contact object that counts related entitlement contacts, you can’t delete entitlements with contacts. To delete an entitlement with a contact in this scenario, either delete the related entitlement contact records first, or remove the roll-up summary field from the Contact object. Sharing Entitlements You can’t share entitlements. Entitlements use the same sharing model as the account they’re associated with. To update an entitlement, you need Read access on the parent account. Associating a customer with an entitlement doesn’t share the entitlement with them. For customers to be able to see their entitlements, entitlements must be set up in your external experience. See Also Verify Entitlements Entitlements: Terms to Know Entitlement Fields Loading "

Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Entitlement A unit of customer support in Salesforce, such as “phone support” or “web support.” It’s typically used to represent terms in warranties. You can associate entitlement with accounts, assets, contacts, and service contracts. View entitlements from the Entitlements tab or the Entitlements related list on accounts, assets, contacts, and service contracts. Note In Lightning Experience, the Entitlements related list isn’t available on Contacts. Entitlement Contact Contacts who are entitled to customer support—for example, a named caller. The Contacts related list on an entitlement shows which contacts are eligible for that entitlement. You can remove or add contacts directly from the related list, or by updating the contact record itself. Your business may not allow you to provide support to customers unless they are a contact on the entitlement. Note Contacts on an account don’t automatically inherit the account’s entitlements. Depending on your business processes, you may need to create a separate entitlement for each contact on an account. You can also set up an Apex trigger that automatically assigns an entitlement to a contact when you create the contact. Entitlement contacts don’t have page layouts, search layouts, buttons, links, or record types. The same visibility and sharing settings that apply to the parent account apply to contacts. Associating a contact with an entitlement doesn’t share the entitlement record with the contact or the related experience user. Entitlement Template Predefined terms of customer support that can be quickly added to products in Salesforce. For example, you can create entitlement templates for phone or web support so users can easily add entitlements to products purchased by customers. Note In Lightning Experience, the contact related list isn’t available on Entitlements. Entitlement Management A collection of Salesforce features that help you provide the correct service levels to your customers. It includes: Entitlements, which let support agents determine whether a customer is eligible for support. Entitlement processes, which are timelines that include all the steps that your support team must complete to resolve support records like cases or work orders. Service contracts, which let you represent different kinds of customer support agreements like warranties, subscriptions, or maintenance agreements. You can restrict service contracts to cover specific products. Experience access to entitlements, which lets experience users view entitlements and service contracts and create support records from them. Reporting on entitlement management, which lets you track the way entitlements are used in your Salesforce org and whether service contract terms are being met. Depending on your business needs, you may decide to use all of these features or just a few of them. Service Contract A customer support agreement between you and your customers. Service contracts in Salesforce can represent warranties, subscriptions, service level agreements (SLAs), and other types of customer support. View service contracts in the Service Contracts tab or on the Service Contracts related list on accounts and contacts. Contract Line Item Specific products covered by a service contract. View contract line items in the Contract Line Items related list on service contracts (not contracts!). You can only use contract line items if your org uses products. Note Schedules aren’t available for contract line items, and experience users can’t access them. Entitlement Process A timeline that includes all the steps (milestones) that support agents must complete to resolve a support record. Each process includes the logic needed to determine how to enforce the correct service level for your customers. Entitlement processes come in two types: Case and Work Order. Not all entitlements need processes. For example, a simple entitlement might just state that a customer is eligible for phone support 24/7. If you need to add time-dependent steps or service levels to that definition—for example, if you want a supervisor to be notified by email when a customer’s case goes unresolved for two hours—you need an entitlement process. Milestone A required step in your entitlement process. Milestones are metrics that represent service levels to provide to each of your customers. Examples of milestones include First Response and Resolution Time on cases. Milestone Action A time-dependent workflow action that occurs on a milestone in an entitlement process. For example, you might add the following actions to a milestone: Send an email alert to certain users one hour before a first response milestone is scheduled to expire Update certain fields on a case one minute after a first response is completed There are three types of milestone actions: Success actions are triggered when a milestone is completed Warning actions are triggered when a milestone is about to be violated Violation actions are triggered when a milestone is violated You can automate tasks, email alerts, field updates, and outbound messages for each action type.

A descriptive name helps users better understand entitlements when they see them on related lists for accounts, contacts, and assets. Operating Hours The operating hours applied to the entitlement’s work orders. This field is visible only if Field Service is enabled. Service Contract The service contract associated with the entitlement. To quickly find a service contract in the lookup dialog box, select criteria from the Filter by fields. Admins can set lookup filters to restrict filter values and results. Start Date The first day the entitlement is in effect. This field is blank unless you set up an Apex trigger or quick action to populate it. For example, you can create a quick action that sets the Start Date to the date when the Status changes to Active . Entitlement Process The entitlement process associated with the entitlement. Entitlement processes are timelines that include all the steps (milestones) that your support team must complete to resolve cases. Each process includes logic to determine how to enforce the correct service level for your customers. Remaining Cases The number of cases the entitlement can support. This field decreases in value by one each time a case is created with the entitlement. This field is only available if Per Incident is selected. Remaining Work Orders The number of work orders remaining that can be raised against this entitlement. Status The entitlement’s status. Status is determined by your Salesforce org’s current system date and the entitlement’s Start Date and End Date . The status is: Active if the system date is equal to or later than the Start Date and equal to or earlier than the End Date . Expired if the system date is later than the End Date . Inactive if the system date is earlier than the Start Date . Status Icon Represents the entitlement’s status with one of the following icons: Active Expired Inactive Type The type of entitlement, such as Web or phone support. Admins can customize this field’s values. Work Orders Per Entitlement The total number of work orders the entitlement supports. See Also Entitlements: Terms to Know "

Select a recurrence type. Recurrence Type Description Example No Recurrence The milestone occurs only once on the record. First Response Resolution Time Independent The milestone occurs whenever the milestone criteria are met on the record. Response Time Sequential The milestone occurs on repeat whenever the milestone criteria are met on the record. Customer Contact Made Click Save . You can’t apply a milestone to a record by itself. It must be part of an entitlement process. So after you create your milestone, add it to an entitlement process . Tip You can add validation rules to a milestone so that users can update a milestone only if it meets specific standards. For details, see Limit User Updates to Milestones .

In your trigger, define which events and related case criteria must be satisfied for a milestone to be marked Completed. You can implement a similar trigger to auto-complete work order milestones. and User Permissions Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud User Permissions Needed To define Apex triggers and classes: Author Apex Tip In Lightning Experience, agents can click the Mark Completed link in the Milestones component to mark a milestone completed. It’s not automation, but it is easy. For more information, see Set Up the Milestone Tracker . The following triggers mark specific types of milestones Completed when the case they are on meets unique criteria. We’ve also provided a milestone utility Apex class and accompanying unit tests. Define the milestone utility class before you use any of the triggers. Milestone Utility Apex Class Apex classes reduce the size of your triggers and make it easier to reuse and maintain Apex code. To define this Apex class in your org: From Setup, enter Apex Classes in the Quick Find box, then click Apex Classes . Click New . Copy the class text and paste it into the text field. Click Save . public class MilestoneUtils { public static void completeMilestone(List<Id> caseIds, String milestoneName, DateTime complDate) { List<CaseMilestone> cmsToUpdate = [select Id, completionDate from CaseMilestone cm where caseId in :caseIds and cm.MilestoneType.Name=:milestoneName and completionDate = null limit 1]; if (cmsToUpdate.isEmpty() == false){ for (CaseMilestone cm : cmsToUpdate){ cm.completionDate = complDate; } update cmsToUpdate; } } } Apex Class Unit Test You can set up Apex unit tests in the developer console to scan your code for any issues. /** * This class contains unit tests for validating the behavior of Apex classes * and triggers. * * Unit tests are class methods that verify whether a particular piece * of code is working properly.

It’s a great way to enforce case resolution terms in SLAs. This sample case trigger marks each Resolution Time milestone Completed when its case is closed. This way, the support agent doesn’t have to manually mark the milestone completed after closing the case. Note This trigger references the milestone utility test class, so be sure to define the test class first. To define this trigger in your org: From Setup, enter Case Triggers in the Quick Find box, then click Case Triggers . Click New . Copy the trigger text and paste it into the text field. Click Save . trigger CompleteResolutionTimeMilestone on Case (after update) { if (UserInfo.getUserType() == 'Standard'){ DateTime completionDate = System.now(); List<Id> updateCases = new List<Id>(); for (Case c : Trigger.new){ if (((c.isClosed == true)||(c.Status == 'Closed'))&&((c.SlaStartDate <= completionDate)&&(c.SlaExitDate == null))) updateCases.add(c.Id); } if (updateCases.isEmpty() == false) milestoneUtils.completeMilestone(updateCases, 'Resolution Time', completionDate); } } Sample Trigger 2 You can create a milestone named First Response that requires agents to get in touch with a case contact within X minutes or hours of the case’s creation. It’s a nice way to ensure that your support team is communicating with case contacts as soon as possible. This sample email trigger marks a First Response milestone Completed when an email is sent to the case contact. That way, the support agent doesn’t have to manually mark the First Response milestone Completed after they email the case contact. Note This trigger references the milestone utility test class, so be sure to define the test class first. To define this trigger in your org: From Setup, enter Email Triggers in the Quick Find box, then click Email Triggers . Click New . Copy the trigger text and paste it into the text field. Click Save . trigger CompleteFirstResponseEmail on EmailMessage (after insert) { if (UserInfo.getUserType() == 'Standard'){ DateTime completionDate = System.now(); Map<Id, String> emIds = new Map<Id, String>(); for (EmailMessage em : Trigger.new){ if(em.Incoming == false) emIds.put(em.ParentId, em.ToAddress); } if (emIds.isEmpty() == false){ Set <Id> emCaseIds = new Set<Id>(); emCaseIds = emIds.keySet(); List<Case> caseList = [Select c.Id, c.ContactId, c.Contact.Email, c.OwnerId, c.Status, c.EntitlementId, c.SlaStartDate, c.SlaExitDate From Case c where c.Id IN :emCaseIds]; if (caseList.isEmpty()==false){ List<Id> updateCases = new List<Id>(); for (Case caseObj:caseList) { if ((emIds.get(caseObj.Id)==caseObj.Contact.Email)&& (caseObj.Status == 'In Progress')&& (caseObj.EntitlementId != null)&& (caseObj.SlaStartDate <= completionDate)&& (caseObj.SlaStartDate != null)&& (caseObj.SlaExitDate == null)) updateCases.add(caseObj.Id); } if(updateCases.isEmpty() == false) milestoneUtils.completeMilestone(updateCases, 'First Response', completionDate); } } } } Sample Trigger 3 While the previous trigger dealt with email messages, this sample case comment trigger marks a First Response milestone Completed when a public comment is made on the case. You can use it if a public case comment is a valid first response in your support terms. Note This trigger references the milestone utility test class, so be sure to define the test class first. To define this trigger in your org: From Setup, enter Case Comment Triggers in the Quick Find box, then click Case Comment Triggers . Click New .

Actions can be added to milestones after the milestone is added to an entitlement process. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud For example, you can create a milestone action that: Sends an email alert to certain users an hour before a First Response milestone is near violation Updates certain fields on a case one minute after a First Response milestone successfully completes You can add three types of actions to milestones: Action Type Description Success Actions The actions to take when a milestone successfully completes. Success actions still fire on milestones that are completed late. Warning Actions The actions to take when a milestone is near violation. Violation Actions The actions to take when a milestone is violated. You can automate these actions for each action type: Workflow Action What It Does Example New Task Create a workflow task Create a task for a support agent to call a customer when a First Response milestone is violated. New Email Create an email alert Notify case owners when a First Response milestone on their case is near violation. New Field Update Define a field update Update the case Priority field to High when a First Response milestone is near violation. New Flow Create an autolaunched flow Send a Slack notification to agents when a First Response milestone is near violation. New Outbound Message Define an outbound message Send data about parts or services to an external system after a First Response milestone is completed. Select Existing Action Select an existing action Use an existing email alert to notify a case owner when their case is near violation of a first response. Things to consider while using milestone actions: Time trigger action calculations don’t account for a case’s milestone business hours. Field updates temporarily lock a case and can trigger automation such as case assignment rules. Field updates have a processing time limit of 10 seconds. Longer updates fail without an error. Reasons for this type of failure include updates to a field that’s already locked or complex business logic that runs longer than 10 seconds. Warning and Violation actions don’t honor the business hours for the minutes, hours, and days, before or after the milestone target date. These actions are converted into minutes on a 24-hour clock, and don’t use business hours. Example Acme has their business hours set to 8 hours a day for 5 days a week (Monday though Friday). In minutes, that’s 480 minutes per day. They have a milestone with a time trigger of 1,919 minutes, which is four full business days. 5,760 minutes is four 24-hour days. They defined a warning action time trigger as ""2 Days Before"". Here, that means 2,880 minutes before the milestone target date. A case comes in that meets the milestone entry criteria on Monday at 9 AM. The target date for the case is 16:59 PM on the coming Thursday. Because the warning action uses a 24-hour clock, the warning must be issued 2,880 minutes, or six business days, beforehand. Given this setup requires the warning to be issued in the past, or on the previous Thursday, the warning action executes immediately.

Learn what each recurrence type means and when to use it. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud There are three milestone recurrence types in Salesforce: Recurrence Type What It Means How the Start Date is Determined Examples No Recurrence The milestone only occurs once on the support record*. The Start Date is the time when the milestone criteria are met on the record. “First Response” “Resolution Time” Independent The milestone occurs whenever the milestone criteria match the record criteria. Note Only one occurrence of an independently recurring milestone can be active at a time. The Start Date is the time when the milestone criteria are met on the record, regardless of when the previous occurrence was completed. “Response Time” Sequential The milestone occurs on repeat whenever the milestone criteria match the record criteria. Note Only one occurrence of a sequentially recurring milestone can be active at a time. For the first occurrence, the Start Date is the time when the milestone criteria are met on the case. For future occurrences: The Start Date is the time when the milestone criteria are met on the record, as long as it’s later than the previous occurrence’s Target Date. If an occurrence is completed before its Target Date and the milestone criteria are met on the record again, the next occurrence starts at the previous occurrence’s Target Date. If an occurrence is completed after its Target Date, the next occurrence’s Start Date is the time when the milestone criteria are met on the record. “Customer Contact Made” *In these definitions, a support record includes cases and work orders. Example No Recurrence Type A milestone named “Resolution Time” is set up to ensure that cases are resolved within 4 hours. The milestone has one criterion: Case: Status EQUALS New,Working,Escalated. Here’s how this milestone can be used: At 10 a.m., a case is created whose Status is New , causing the milestone criteria to match the case criteria. The “Resolution Time” milestone is automatically created with these settings: Start Date = 10 a.m. (the current time) Target Date = 2 p.m. (4 hours from the Start Date) At 1 p.m., the support agent resolves the customer’s issue and closes the case, and the milestone is marked complete. Independent A milestone named “Engineer Solution Proposed” is set up to track case escalation to Engineering. When this milestone occurs, the support agent expects a proposed solution from Engineering within 4 hours. The milestone has one criterion: “Case: Status EQUALS Waiting on Engineer” (a custom status). Here’s how this milestone can be used: At 10 a.m., the support agent escalates a case to Engineering, causing the milestone criteria to match the case criteria. An occurrence of the “Engineer Solution Proposed” milestone is automatically created with these settings: Start Date = 10 a.m. (the current time) Target Date = 2 p.m. (4 hours after the Start Date) At 11 a.m., well before the Target Date, an engineer proposes a solution that’s sent to the customer. The milestone is marked complete manually or via a workflow. If the proposed solution works, there may be no other occurrences of the “Engineer Solution Proposed” milestone on the case. However, if the solution doesn’t solve the customer’s issue, another occurrence would be created: At 1 p.m., the support agent re-escalates the case to Engineering, causing the milestone criteria to match the case criteria. A second occurrence of the “Engineer Solution Proposed” milestone is created with these settings: Start Date = 1 p.m. (the current time) Target Date = 5 p.m. (4 hours after the Start Date) The case now has two “Engineer Solution Proposed” milestones: One completed milestone that started at 10 a.m. One incomplete milestone that started at 1 p.m. and has a Target Date of 5 p.m. The milestone can recur as many times as necessary until the entitlement process is completed. Sequential A milestone named “Customer Contact Made” is set up to track daily contact with a customer as part of an SLA. When this milestone occurs, the support agent has 24 hours to communicate with the customer. Here’s how this milestone can be used: At 10 a.m. on Monday, a case is created whose entitlement process includes the “Customer Contact Made” milestone. The milestone has these settings: Start Date = 10 a.m. Monday (the current time) Target Date = 10 a.m. Tuesday (24 hours after the Start Date) At 11 a.m. on Monday, the support agent communicates with the customer. This means that the milestone can be marked complete, and milestone’s second occurrence is created. However, because the previous occurrence’s Target Date is still in the future, the Start Date of the second occurrence is 10 a.m. Tuesday. The case now has two “Customer Contact Made” milestones: One completed milestone that started at 10 a.m. Monday One incomplete milestone that is scheduled to start at 10 a.m. Tuesday with a Target Date of 10 a.m. Wednesday If the support agent communicates with the customer multiple times on Monday, it doesn’t affect the Tuesday milestone.

Find out where you can use milestones in Salesforce. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud What types of records can I add milestones to? Cases Work orders Incidents How do I add milestones to a record? Here are the general steps you’ll follow: Create “master” milestones in Setup that represent required steps in your support process. Add the milestones to an entitlement process, which is a customizable timeline of milestones. Apply the entitlement process to a customer entitlement. When you link a support record, such as a work order, to an entitlement that includes an entitlement process, the process—with its milestones—is automatically applied to the record. To learn more, see Set Up Milestones . Can I use the same entitlement for work orders and cases? If the entitlement has an entitlement process associated with it, don’t use the entitlement for multiple types of support records. Every entitlement process has a type—Case or Work Order—and a process only works on records that match its type. For example, when a Case entitlement process is applied to an entitlement, the process runs only on cases associated with the entitlement. If a work order is also associated with the entitlement, the process doesn’t run on the work order. When I create a milestone, can I add it to both types of entitlement processes? Yes. For example, if you create a First Response milestone in Setup, you can add it to both Case and Work Order entitlement processes. How do I set the type of an entitlement process? You select the type when you create the entitlement process. Entitlement processes created before Summer ’16 use the Case type. You can see an entitlement process’s type on its detail page. Can I change the type of an entitlement process? No. Once an entitlement process is created, all its versions must use the same type. Want to make the most of a particularly awesome entitlement process? Remember that you can easily create a similar process of a different type using the same milestones. Are milestones supported in Lightning Experience? Milestones are available in Lightning Experience with some limitations. For details, see Entitlement Management Limits and Limitations . Where do I manage milestones in my org? View and create milestones from the Milestones node in Setup under Entitlement Management. Manage case milestone page layouts and validations rules from the Case Milestones node in Setup. Manage work order milestone page layouts and validation rules from the Object Milestones node in Setup. "

Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Before you use milestones and entitlement processes, make sure that the Entitlement Process End Time field is added to the record page layout. General Rule for Milestone Timers The milestone timer stops based on the first action taken to stop it and not the most recent one. Stop a Milestone Timer Manually Agents can choose to manually stop a record’s milestone timer manually by selecting either Is Stopped or Incident Paused , depending on the object. The milestone timer records the time when the checkbox was selected. Resume a Milestone Timer Manually If the record hasn’t exited the entitlement process and the milestone timer was previously stopped manually, an agent can resume the milestone timer by deselecting the Is Stopped or Incident Paused checkbox. Stop a Milestone Timer with an Entitlement Process When a record exits an entitlement process and the milestone timer wasn’t already manually stopped, the milestone timer is stopped at the time that the record exits the process. If a record exits the entitlement process, but a user clicks Is Stopped or Incident Paused afterwards, the milestone timer stops at the time that the entitlement exits and not when the checkbox is selected. Resume a Milestone Timer with an Entitlement Process If the record reenters the entitlement process and the milestone timer wasn’t previously stopped manually, the timer resumes from the time that the record exited the entitlement process. Milestone Timers Ignore Stops After the Milestone Target Date Is Violated When a record violates the milestone timer’s target date, the milestone timer calculates the amount of time that the milestone is overdue. Milestone timers count the total amount of time after the milestone is violated, regardless of whether the timer was stopped after the violation. If a user selects Is Stopped or Incident Paused after the milestone is in violation, the timer appears to be paused at the time that it was stopped, but if the checkbox is deselected, the timer also includes the period where it was paused. For example, a milestone timer is stopped 20 seconds after it’s in violation. After 20 more seconds, the agent resumes the timer, which now reflects a 40-second violation. Milestone Timers Inside and Outside Of Business Hours If a milestone is stopped and restarted inside of business hours, the timer resumes where it left off. For example, if the timer stopped with 10 hours and 5 minutes left and was paused for 5 minutes, when it resumes it has 10 hours and 5 minutes left. If a milestone is stopped and restarted outside of business hours, the amount of time that passes while it’s paused gets added to the timer. For example, if the timer stopped with 10 hours and 5 minutes left and was paused for 5 minutes, when it resumes it has 10 hours and 10 minutes left. "

Tip The Entitlement Management Trailhead module introduces you to common terms and walks you through creating an entitlement process. And, it’s fun! To get started, see Entitlement Management . From Setup, enter Entitlement Processes in the Quick Find box, then select Entitlement Processes under Entitlement Management. Click New Entitlement Process . Select an entitlement process type. If you intend to use the process to enforce milestones on cases, select Case. If you intend to use the process to enforce milestones on work orders, select Work Order. (If work orders aren’t enabled in your org, you only see the Case option.) Note If you’re using entitlement processes, manage customers’ work orders and cases on separate entitlements. This is because an entitlement process only runs on records that match its type. For example, when a Case entitlement process is applied to an entitlement, the process only runs on cases associated with the entitlement. If a work order is also associated with the entitlement, the process won’t run on the work order. Enter a name—for example, Standard Support Process —and a description. If you want to enable the process, select Active . Tip We recommend waiting to activate an entitlement process until you add milestone actions to it. You can’t update or delete milestone actions on a process after it’s activated and applied to a record. Optionally, if entitlement versioning is enabled, select Default Version to make this version of the entitlement process the default. Choose the criteria for records to enter and exit the entitlement process. Field Description More Actions to Take? Record* enters the process Based on record created date Select if records should enter the process when they’re created. No Based on a custom date/time field on the record Select if you want the value of a custom date/time field on the record to determine when the record enters the process. Yes, a drop-down list displays for selecting the custom date/time. You can only choose a custom date/time, not a custom date.

No Based on custom criteria Select if records should exit the process based on criteria you define. Yes, select one of the following: Choose criteria are met and select the filter criteria that a record must meet for it to exit the process. For example, set a case filter to Priority equals Low if you want cases with the Priority field marked Low to exit the process. Choose formula evaluates to true and enter a formula that returns a value of “True” or “False.” Salesforce triggers the rule if the formula returns “True.” Choose formula evaluates to true and enter a formula that returns a value of “True” or “False.” Records exit the process if the formula returns “True.” For example, the formula (Case: Priority equals Low) AND(Case: Case Origin equals Email, Web) moves cases out of the process if their Priority field is Low and the Case Origin field is marked Email or Web. *The field names you see will reflect the entitlement process type you selected. Optionally, choose the business hours you’d like to apply to the entitlement process. The business hours you set here calculate the Target Date for all the milestones on this entitlement process.

If a case is stopped and a user doesn’t have access to the Stopped field, the Case Milestone component in Lightning Experience continues to track time for them, even though the timer is paused. Until the Stopped field is updated (unpaused), each time the user refreshes the case record, the milestone timer restarts from the current local time. If this is happening, the user might not have access to the Stopped Since field.

Or, if you’d like the trigger time for the milestone to be calculated dynamically based on the milestone type and properties of the case or work order, click Enable Apex Class for the Time Trigger (Minutes) . Note You must have a custom Apex class that implements the Support.MilestoneTriggerTimeCalculator Apex interface to use this option. If you selected Enable Apex Class for the Time Trigger (Minutes) , use the lookup to specify an Apex class for the dynamically calculated milestone. Choose when the milestone starts: Select To Use If Milestone Criteria Calculate the milestone Target Date when the milestone is applied to a support record (matches the record criteria). A milestone’s Target Date is based on when it’s applied to a record. Use if the milestone is recurring. Note An entitlement process usually starts when the record is created, but its milestones aren’t always applied right away. Entitlement Process Calculate the milestone Target Date when the entitlement process starts (by default, when a support record is created). A milestone's Target Date is based on the start of the entitlement process. For example, first response and resolution times on a case always calculate their Target Date when the entitlement process starts. Optionally, select the business hours that you want to apply to the Target Date calculation for this milestone. If you don’t specify business hours for the milestone, then the Entitlement Process business hours are used. If neither are specified, then the business hours on the case or work order are used. Specify the order in which Salesforce should process the milestones. This applies to situations where a support record matches the criteria of multiple milestones at the same time. Enter the criteria a record must match for the milestone to apply to it: Choose criteria are met and select the filter criteria that a record must meet for a milestone to apply to it. For example, set a case filter to Priority equals High if you want the milestone to apply to cases with the Priority field marked High. Choose formula evaluates to true and enter a formula that returns a value of “True” or “False.” Salesforce triggers the rule if the formula returns “True.” Choose formula evaluates to true and enter a formula that returns a value of “True” or “False.” The milestone applies to records if the formula returns “True.” For example, the formula (Case: Priority equals High) AND (Case: Case Origin equals Email, Web) applies the milestone to cases where the Priority field is High and the Case Origin field is marked Email or Web. You can’t use the Case Owner field in formulas. Click Save . Note Milestones are measured in minutes and seconds, but their start and end times are only accurate to the minute. For example, suppose a milestone is triggered at 11:10:40 a.m. and the time to complete the milestone is 10 minutes. In this case, the milestone target time is 11:20:00 am, not 11:20:40. As a result, the remaining time for the agent to complete the milestone is 9 minutes and 20 seconds, not the full 10 minutes.

Learn how support records like cases and work orders move through an entitlement process. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud A support agent linked a record to an entitlement that has an entitlement process. This can be done in several ways: The support agent creates the record from the Cases or Work Orders related list on the entitlement. The support agent creates the record, then uses the Entitlement lookup field on the record to select the proper entitlement. The record enters the process based on its creation date or a custom date/time field. A custom date/time field lets users edit a date on the record to trigger when it enters the process. Salesforce assigns milestones with matching criteria to the record. For example, if a milestone’s criteria is Priority equals High , and a case has a Priority of High , Salesforce assigns it to the Priority equals High milestone. A record associates with one milestone at a time. It can associate with many milestones as it moves through the process. Milestone actions determine when and if warning, violation, or success workflow actions fire for the record. A support agent updates the record to complete a milestone action. After a record is updated, it cycles through the entitlement process and initiates any milestones that match its criteria. The record exits the process based on custom criteria or when it’s closed. You can view records with assigned entitlements by creating case or work order list views that filter on entitlement process fields.

Learn how Salesforce approaches business hours in these situations. Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud On records that include entitlement processes, business hours are applied according to a hierarchy. Salesforce uses the business hours specified at the highest level. So a milestone’s business hours override the entitlement process’ business hours, which override the case or work order’s business hours. If no business hours are set on the milestone, then the entitlement process business hours are used. And if business hours aren’t specified on the milestone or the entitlement process, the case or work order business hours are used. You can also set business hours on entitlements. If you create a record from an entitlement, it inherits the entitlement’s business hours. However, if the entitlement is part of an entitlement process, we recommend leaving the entitlement’s business hours field blank. Related records automatically use the entitlement process’ business hours. When you set or update business hours, follow these best practices. If you want to use the same entitlement process for records that have different business hours, set business hours at the entitlement process level. For example, suppose that you set the business hours on an entitlement process to weekdays from 9 to 5. If a customer requests evening and weekend updates to their case, you can create an “Update Customer” milestone with its own 24/7 business hours. If you want to use different business hours for different severity levels, set business hours at the milestone level. For example, if the severity level of a case increases, you need to contact the customer more frequently. You can create a “Last Touch” milestone that changes business hours according to severity level while the other milestones in the entitlement process remain unchanged. To change the business hours specified on an active entitlement process, follow these steps. Before you start, make sure entitlement versioning is enabled on the Entitlement Settings page in Setup. Open the entitlement process for which you want to change the business hours. On the Entitlement Process Detail page, click Create New Version . This new version inherits the business hours from the original version. Change the business hours. Save your changes. Optionally, add or remove any holidays during which business hours are suspended. Go back to the original version and click New Update Rule under Entitlement and Support Record Update Rule. In Version to Update from, select the new version and click Save . The new business hours are now updated in the original entitlement process and in the milestone timer. Delete the new version if it’s not needed anymore. See Also Set Up Entitlement Processes "

Note To create multiple versions of entitlement processes, entitlement versioning must be enabled in your org. Select Enable Entitlement Versioning on the Entitlement Settings page in Setup. When you create versions of entitlement processes with the same name, the version number and notes help you differentiate between versions. Salesforce prevents you from disabling entitlement versioning so you always know which version you’re working with. When you create a new version of an entitlement process, you can change any of the following: Name Description Whether the process is active Whether the version is the default Entry criteria Exit criteria You can also add notes about the version. This makes it easy to differentiate between multiple versions of the same process, especially if they have the same name. On new versions of entitlement processes that are currently in use, you can add new milestones, but you can’t edit existing ones. On new versions of processes that aren’t currently in use, you can both add new milestones and edit existing ones.

In the Entitlement Process Versions list, click the version of the process from which you want to create a new version. On the Entitlement Process Detail page, click Create New Version . Add details about the new version. Follow these best practices: Use the Version Notes field to explain what makes the version you’re creating different from others. This makes it easier to differentiate between multiple versions of the same entitlement process. Leave the name as is. Click Active to be able to use the new version. Click Default if you want to make the new version the default version of the process. This makes it easier to find in lookup field searches. Click Save . After saving, you can modify the entitlement process’ milestones if needed. Important On new versions of entitlement processes that are currently in use, you can add new milestones, but you can’t edit existing ones. On new versions of processes that aren’t currently in use, you can both add new milestones and edit existing ones. All versions of an entitlement process must be the same type. When you create a new version of an entitlement process, it isn’t automatically applied to entitlements that were using the previous version.

Applying an Entitlement Process to a New Entitlement Scenario: You’re creating an entitlement and want to apply a particular version of an entitlement process to it.

Tip After you click the lookup icon on the Entitlement Process field, select “All Versions” in the lookup dialog box. Otherwise, you can only choose from the default versions of existing entitlement processes. Applying an Entitlement Process to an Existing Entitlement Scenario: You made a new version of an entitlement process, and you want to switch all the entitlements that were using the previous version over to your new version. From Setup, enter Entitlement Processes in the Quick Find box, then select Entitlement Processes . Click the name of the entitlement process you want to work with. The list on the main Entitlement Processes page shows the default version of each process. Click the name of a process to see a list of all available versions of it. On the detail page for the entitlement process, click the name of the new version that you want to apply to existing entitlements (and by default, to cases or work orders linked to those entitlements). Click New Update Rule . Choose the version of the entitlement process you want to update from. You can update from any other version of the process, whether or not it’s active. Depending on the differences between the old and new versions of the entitlement process, updating an entitlement to the new version can trigger milestone warning and violation actions on that entitlement’s support records (such as cases or work orders). To avoid such warnings and violation actions, select Don’t Trigger New Milestone Warnings and Violations . We recommend selecting this so you don’t trigger violation warnings on old entitlements and support records. Click Save . The update rule detail page shows the estimated number of entitlements and support records that will be updated to use the new process. Click Start to begin the update process. Usually the update process completes within an hour, but it depends on the number of entitlements and records being updated. Throughout the update process, the update rule detail page refreshes periodically to show the number of entitlements and records processed. To stop the update at any time, click Stop . When the update rule displays a Completed status, all related entitlements and support records have been updated to use the new version of the entitlement process. If the status is Completed With Exceptions , some records couldn't be updated to the new version because of errors. To find out which records weren't updated and why, contact Salesforce Support. Note Cases that have already exited the previous version of your entitlement process—for example, if a case has been closed—are updated to use the new entitlement process.

Required User Permissions User Permissions Needed To view service contracts: Read on service contracts To edit service contracts: Edit on service contracts To create or clone service contracts: Create on service contracts To delete service contracts: Delete on service contracts Available in both: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Viewing Service Contracts View service contracts from the Service Contracts tab or on the Service Contracts related list on accounts and contacts. To view a service contract’s details, click the service contract name. You can see associated entitlements, contract line items, field update history, and more. The Service Contracts related list on an account or contact shows all the service contacts associated with that item. Tip If service contracts have been set up in the console, click the Console tab to find, view, and edit service contracts and their associated records in one place. Creating Service Contracts You can create and edit service contracts from: The Service Contracts tab The Service Contracts related list on accounts and contacts We recommend linking each service contract to an account in Salesforce. Then, you can create entitlements on the service contract and assign the entitlements to contacts associated with the account. Tip Click Clone on a service contract to quickly create a new service contract from an existing one. Use the Parent Service Contract field and Child Service Contracts related list to make one service contract the parent of another. This helps you represent complex contracts. Entitlements reflect terms in a service contract, and a service contract may be associated with multiple entitlements. Link an entitlement to a service contract via the Entitlements related list on the service contract or the Service Contract lookup field on the entitlement. Deleting Service Contracts You can delete service contracts from the service contract’s detail page or the Service Contracts related list. Deleting a service contract moves it to the Recycle Bin. Any notes, attachments, activities, or contract line items associated with the service contract are also deleted. If you undelete the service contract, the associated items are undeleted. Note You can’t delete service contracts with active or expired entitlements. If you want to delete a service contract with entitlements—for instance, because there’s a problem with the service contract—add its entitlements to another service contract first, then delete it. If you delete a service contract with both a parent service contract and child service contract(s), keep in mind that its parent and children will no longer be linked in a service contract hierarchy. Sharing Service Contracts You can use sharing rules to grant extra access to service contracts beyond what your organization’s default sharing model allows. However, you can’t make the sharing model more restrictive than the default model. To see who has access to a service contract, click Sharing on the service contract’s detail page. This takes you to the sharing detail page. There, you can: View a list of who has access to the service contract. Click Add to grant access to the record for other users, groups, roles, or territories. You can only share service contracts with users who have the “Read” permission on service contracts. Create, edit, and delete manual sharing rules. Define a custom view to filter the list of users with access to the service contract. Transferring Service Contracts Between Users You may need to transfer multiple service contracts to a user. To do this, click the Service Contracts tab and click Transfer Service Contracts in the Tools section. See Also Work with Service Contracts Service Contract Fields Loading "

Available in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions For example, perhaps your business sells a tent which is tracked as an asset, but the tent poles (which customers have a tendency to misplace) are tracked as a separate asset. You can make the tent poles asset a child of the tent asset. To create hierarchical relationships between assets, use the Parent Asset field and the Child Assets related list on asset detail pages. Assets also come with a few additional fields related to hierarchies: The read-only Root Asset field lists the top-level asset in an asset hierarchy. Depending on where an asset lies in the hierarchy, its root might be the same as its parent. If an asset is at the top of a hierarchy, it is its own root asset, and the Parent Asset field is blank. The read-only Asset Level field is a number that reflects the asset’s position in a hierarchy. If the asset has no parent or child assets, its level is 1. Assets that belong to a hierarchy have a level of 1 for the root asset, 2 for the child assets of the root asset, 3 for their children, and so forth. An asset hierarchy can have up to 10,000 assets. Here are some ways to use hierarchical assets to improve your support process. When creating a work order to repair a broken asset, create line items on the work order that correspond to specific child assets. For situations where a work order is created from an asset, set up a workflow rule or process that creates a work order line item for each child asset.\n Set up a trigger that notifies the owner of an asset by email when the install date for one of the asset’s child assets was more than five years before the current date. Note The Parent Asset and Root Asset fields aren’t available in standard reports that include assets. However, you can reference them in custom reports. Viewing Asset Hierarchies To view an expanded tree grid of all assets in an asset’s hierarchy, click View Asset Hierarchy in the drop-down action menu on any asset detail page in Lightning Experience. (That’s in the top right-hand corner of the page.) The action is also available on assets in the console. This view gives field service workers a way to quickly identify parts, assess bills of materials, and understand how assets are related to each other. Click the caret next to each asset name (1) to collapse and expand a node. You can go up to 20 levels deep in a hierarchy. The asset whose hierarchy you’re viewing is shown with a CURRENT stamp (2). The fields that appear in the hierarchy aren’t customizable. If you don’t see the action, add it to your asset page layouts: In the layout editor, select Mobile & Lightning Actions , then drag it onto your page layout. The View Asset Hierarchy action is available only for hierarchies of 500 or fewer assets. If a hierarchy contains more than 500 assets, you can still refer to each asset’s Child Assets related list and Parent Asset, Root Asset, and Asset Level fields. Here’s what happens if you don’t have access to certain elements of an asset hierarchy: If your field-level security settings prohibit you from accessing a particular field in the asset hierarchy view, you can see the field name in the column title, but the column is blank. If sharing settings prohibit you from viewing an asset that’s lower in the current asset’s hierarchy, the restricted asset doesn’t appear in the hierarchy view for you. If sharing settings prohibit you from viewing an asset that’s higher in the current asset’s hierarchy, an error appears and you can’t view the asset hierarchy. This is because record sharing settings also apply to child records. The asset hierarchy view isn’t searchable or editable. It isn’t available in Salesforce Classic, Experience Cloud sites, Salesforce for iOS, Salesforce for Android, or the Field Service Lightning mobile app. Loading "

Available in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can view and manage asset replacements from two related lists on asset detail pages. The Primary Assets related list shows assets that replaced the current asset. The Related Assets related list shows assets that the current asset replaced. For example, suppose an elevator’s door is tracked as an asset named Door Model 1. Your customer decides to install a newer door, and Door Model 1 is replaced with Door Model 2. To track this replacement: Navigate to the Door Model 1 record. In the Primary Assets related list, click New Asset Relationship . In the Asset field, select Door Model 2 . The Related Asset field auto-populates to list Door Model 1. Select a relationship type. This field comes with three options—Replacement, Upgrade, and Crossgrade—but you can define more in Setup. If Door Model 2 will only be installed for a certain amount of time—for example, if it’s being leased—enter a From and To date to indicate when it will be in use. Save your changes. This asset relationship now appears in the Primary Assets related list on the Door Model 1 record, and the Related Assets related list on the Door Model 2 record. (You can get the same results by creating the asset relationship record from the Related Assets related list on the Door Model 2 record.) If Door Model 2 is replaced by Door Model 3 down the road, keep in mind that Door Model 3 won’t appear in either related list on the Door Model 1 asset record. Customize fields, page layouts, and more for asset relationships from the Asset Relationships page in Setup. To save your team time and ensure that asset replacements are adequately tracked, create a flow that automates asset replacements. For example, the flow could be launched in the Field Service mobile app by an on-site technician when an asset is being replaced. "

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Setup Considerations Flows created from the Customer Contact Requests page in Setup don’t appear in the list of flows on the Flows page. You can create contact request flows directly in Flow Builder, but we recommend that you use the guided setup experience on the Customer Contact Requests page in Setup. If you customize the Reason picklist values after the flow is created, you must manually update the picklist values in Flow Builder. Updates to field values aren’t synced with the flow. Contact request flows don’t support pause actions on flow screens. If you enable the Pause action in Flow Builder, the action is ignored at run time. To use a contact request flow provided in an AppExchange package, update the contact request owner to user in your org. To update the owner, use Flow Builder or the Cloud Flow Designer. Specify a user that has at least read permission on the contact request object. Agent Considerations By default, all Standard User and System Administrator profiles have access to the object. Make sure that your agents profiles have at least read access on the contact request object. To save agents time, when they relate a contact request to a new record, we populate relevant fields with information from the contact request. For example, when an agent relates a contact request to a new case, we populate the Status, Priority, Case Origin, Web Phone, Subject, and Description fields on the case record. For new accounts, we populate the Phone field. For new opportunities, we populate the Description field.

Learn More To set up quick text, enable it in Setup, give users access to quick text, and create your messages. After users receive access, they can insert the quick text messages into conversations and records. The quick text browser on supported records helps users find and insert the right messages for the situation. Here are three ways to make the most of quick text. Organize quick text messages into shareable folders to help agents find the perfect message. For example, create separate folders for your business units, such as support and sales or tiers 1 and 2. Share each folder with the appropriate users to help them quickly find the right message for any situation. Use quick text categories to indicate each message’s purpose. Categorize quick text messages into greetings, FAQ, closings, or your own custom categories. Let users create and manage their own quick text. Give selected users the ability to create quick text messages for themselves or for multiple users. Design Your Quick Text Strategy Before you get started using quick text, run through these planning questions. They help you and your team use quick text effectively to save time. Enable Quick Text Enable quick text for your org so that your users can insert predefined messages into customer conversations and records. Optionally, customize your quick text categories to make each message’s purpose clear. Create Quick Text Messages Create custom predefined messages to insert into emails, chats, tasks, events, and more. Quick text can include merge fields, line breaks, and special characters. Give Users Access to Quick Text Giving users access to quick text lets them insert predefined messages in their emails, chats, events, tasks, Knowledge articles, and more. Service agents can respond to customers and update cases quickly and easily. Sales reps can work with their contacts, accounts, and opportunities more efficiently. Share Quick Text You can share quick text with users, public groups, and more. The way you share quick text in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience is different. In Salesforce Classic, you can share individual quick text messages. In Lightning Experience, you share quick text using folders. Insert and Use Quick Text Stop retyping the same message over and over, and save time. Use quick text to insert predefined messages on any standard or custom objects in Knowledge articles, Chats, Log a Call actions, emails, events, tasks, and social posts. After inserting a quick text message into a message field, you have the chance to tailor the text to your situation before sending it.

Available in Salesforce Classic in: Group, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Available in Lightning Experience in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Who should be able to use quick text in their communications with customers, and in which channels? Usually, this is all or most users. Each quick text message can be associated with one or more communication channels, like Chat or Email. If a quick text message isn’t associated with a particular channel, you can’t use it in that channel. Quick text can be used in these channels. Email Event Internal: For internal fields (Salesforce Classic only) Knowledge Chat Messaging Phone: For the Log a Call action Portal: For Experience Cloud sites or customer portals (Salesforce Classic only) Social: For social posts Task Who should be able to create quick text messages for themselves? Optionally, select one or more users, such as service agents, who can create and maintain their own quick text messages to use in their communications with customers. Keep in mind that letting many users create quick text messages decreases the standardization of your company messaging. Who should be able to create quick text messages for multiple users? Optionally, select one or more users, such as supervisors, who can create and share quick text messages with other users. Do you want to create unique sets of quick text messages for different business units? If your company has multiple business units with their own processes, customers, and terminology, it’s a good idea to create separate sets of quick text for each unit. In Lightning Experience, you can divide these sets of quick text messages into folders and give each group of users access to the appropriate folder. In Salesforce Classic, you can customize access using sharing rules or share individual quick text messages with users. In which scenarios does your team need quick text messages? Make a list of the top scenarios that need standardized messaging. For example, perhaps you want to standardize: Customer service chat greetings Responses to frequently asked questions Introductions to new products or promotions Then, work with your team to finalize the quick text for each scenario. Support agents and sales reps may maintain their own lists of common responses that you can refer to. Keep in mind that different channels may require different language for a given scenario—for example, a standard Chat greeting might be more casual than an Email greeting. Tip Einstein Reply Recommendations can complete this step for you by generating a list of your team’s common responses based on past chats. You can then fine-tune and publish those replies to quick text. After you answer these planning questions, you’re ready to roll out quick text to your team.

When a user shares a folder, all messages in the folder are shared. Important Sharing settings on folders override sharing settings on individual quick text messages. If you shared a quick text message in Salesforce Classic, that sharing is ignored after folder sharing is turned on and the quick text is assigned to a folder. If folder sharing is turned off later, the individual sharing settings once again apply. Confirm that folder sharing is turned on and visible to users. On the Quick Text Settings page in Setup, select Share and organize quick text in folders . This setting lets users see folders in the quick text browser and list view. It also disables the Share button on quick text records in Salesforce Classic that belong to a folder. Once you turn it on, we recommend leaving it on.

You can share only the first-level folders, known as root folders. Subfolders inherit their root folder’s settings. Enter the sharing details. You can share with users, groups, roles, or other groupings using a combination. If a user is given access twice, their higher permission level is granted. For example, a group is added with View access, but a user in the group also has Edit and Manage permissions. In this case, the user receives the Edit and Manage permissions. Click Share . The sharing setting is applied to the Who Can Access list. To change an entry’s access level, select a new access level. To delete a Who Can Access entry, click X on the entry.

Available in Salesforce Classic in: Group, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Available in Lightning Experience in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions General Considerations The quick text browser displays up to 2000 folders. When you search quick text, all matching quick text and folders display. If you use the Service Setup Assistant to create a Service app, the Assistant creates a folder of sample quick text messages. To access this folder, users need at least Read permission on the Quick Text object and View access to the folder named “Quick Text folder - Sample Quick Texts 1.” You can’t translate Quick Text through the Translation Workbench. To use quick text in multiple languages, we recommend designating users to create quick text records for their language. Subcategories are available only in Salesforce Classic. The Share button for individual quick text records is available only in Salesforce Classic. Quick text counts towards your Salesforce org’s data storage limit. Quick Text Channel and Object Support Admins can customize the names of quick text channels in Object Manager, but we recommend that you don’t. Renaming standard values can prevent quick text messages from being available in the correct channels. In addition, if you customize quick text channel names in Lightning Experience, the names are no longer translated. Quick text is supported in Lightning Knowledge on rich text fields only. Quick text that reps and agents save to the Email channel for their own use is available as a text shortcut in the Outlook and Gmail integrations with Inbox. Shared quick text isn’t available in the integrations. The Portal and Internal channels aren’t supported in Lightning Experience. These channels appear in the list of available channels when creating quick text, but they aren’t mapped to any actions in Lightning Experience. You can’t use the Event and Task channels with custom fields. Macros don’t observe quick text channels. Merge Field Considerations In quick text, you can insert merge fields for accounts, cases, contacts, custom objects, leads, opportunities, organization, users, and work orders. When merge fields don’t apply to the record you’re working with, the merge field resolves blank. For example: Quick text with the Case.CaseNumber merge field resolves correctly in a case’s Log a Call action. However, that same merge field resolves blank when inserting quick text on a work order’s Log a Call action. Quick text with the Lead.Name merge field resolves correctly on a lead. However, that same merge field resolves blank on an account that was converted from a lead. In Chat, you can only use merge fields for the following objects: case, contact, and lead. You can use merge fields for accounts only if the account record is related to a case, contact, or custom object that is associated with the chat transcript. You can’t use merge fields in quick text for Lightning Knowledge. Merge fields only resolve in the Email global action when you’re on a record page. For example, if you’re viewing a list view and open the Email global action, quick text merge fields don’t resolve. Quick text supports the Salesforce Merge Language (SML) used in Salesforce Classic email templates, not the Handlebars Merge Language (HML) used in Lightning email templates. "

In Salesforce Classic, macros are supported on objects with both feed-based layouts and quick actions. Typically, this support includes (but is not limited to): accounts, cases, contacts, and leads. You can only add the Macros widget to the Salesforce Console for Service. In Lightning Experience, macros are supported on all standard objects except Campaign, and on custom objects that allow quick actions and have a customizable page layout. You can add the Macros utility to any Lightning app, including apps with standard navigation and console navigation such as the Sales and Service Console apps. The following prerequisites apply to Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience: Make sure that the record page you want to use macros with includes a publisher, like the Chatter component, and the actions you want to use, like Email or Log a Call. To customize the page layout, edit the page in Setup. Add the Macros widget or utility to the app. In Salesforce Classic, add the Macros widget to the app from the Apps page in Setup. Look for the Choose Custom Console Components section and add the widget there. In Lightning Experience, add the Macros utility to the app from the App Manager in Setup. Users must have the appropriate user permissions to create and run macros. We recommend that you create a permission set with your desired permissions for the macro object. To allow users to create and manage their own macros, give them create, edit, and delete permission on the macro object. To allow users to run irreversible macros, such as macros that send emails or update field values, go to the Administrative Permissions section, and select Manage Macros Users Can’t Undo . If you are using macros in Salesforce Classic, there are two more prerequisites: Enable feed tracking on the object that you want to run macros on.

Support agents can filter the list views to identify which records to select. Available in Salesforce Classic in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Available in Lightning Experience in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When you create a bulk macro, it’s a good practice to add an instruction that changes a field value on the record. Agents can filter records in the list view based on the field value. Updating a field value lets agents distinguish the records on which the macro has been run from the cases on which the macro hasn’t been run. Example Example: Suppose many customers open cases about the same issue in a short time. The agent runs a bulk macro that sends an email to these customers to tell them that the company knows about the issue and is fixing it. But what happens two days later, when the agent wants to run the bulk macro a second time on new cases about the same issue? In this situation, the agent needs a way to differentiate old cases from new cases. It’s helpful to add instructions to the macro that change a field value, because agents often use filters to determine which cases to apply the macro to. This way, when the macro runs, it automatically updates the field value. Later on, when the agent has new cases to respond to, the agent can filter cases based on this field. "

To create macros, your admin must add the Macro utility to your Lightning app. In Lightning Experience, macros are supported on all standard objects except Campaign, and on custom objects that allow quick actions and have a customizable page layout. In your Lightning app, open a record. In the utility bar, click Macros . Note If you see the message “This page doesn't support macros,” check that you’re on the record page for a supported object. You can’t run macros on list views. Click + or Create Macro . Enter a name, description, folder, and select the object that the macro applies to. Click Save . Macro Name Use a name that makes it easy to understand what this macro does. For example, for a macro that replaces the email subject with a critical update, enter “Replace Email Subject with Critical Update.” Description Explain the purpose for this macro. This optional field helps other agents understand what this macro does and distinguishes it from similar macros. Apply To The Apply To value defaults to the object you were viewing before. Change this default to create a macro for a different object. Folder Folders help you organize and share macros. You can create up to four levels of folders: one root folder and up to three subfolders. This field is visible only when Share and organize macros in folders is enabled. In some orgs, the Folder field must be added to the page layout. Click Edit Instructions . The first instruction is added based on the object you selected from the Apply To field. The Macro Builder page opens. The left side of the page displays a canvas with a sample record page for the object you selected (1). Keep in mind that all fields for the object are available, even if the sample record doesn’t include them. The right side of the page includes an Instructions tab and Details tab for your macro (2). Click Add Logic . Create logical expressions that evaluate a condition or a group of conditions. Then add the instructions that execute when the expression is true. For more information, see Add Logic to Macros in Lightning Experience . To add instructions that execute without evaluating any conditions, on the bottom of the Instructions tab, click Add Instruction . On the canvas, select a quick action. Selectable items are highlighted on the canvas. For example, on a case record, you can click Log A Call in the publisher. On the canvas, click a field to add instructions. In the Instructions tab, enter your field updates. You can insert quick text, use email templates, add email attachments, create events with relative dates, and more. Optionally, on the canvas, select a submit action to tell the macro to execute these instructions. For example, to have your macro submit your Log a Call comments, click Save in the publisher. Optionally, if your macro is only for records in console apps, you can add an instruction to close the record tab when the macro completes. To add the close tab instruction, click the dropdown menu next to Add Instruction, and select Add Close Tab Instruction . When you’re done with your macro, click Save .

You can build conditional expressions using IF, ELSEIF, and ELSE blocks. You can group and nest conditions within blocks and add multiple expressions. On a record page in a Lightning app, click Macros in the utility bar. Note If you see the message “This page doesn’t support macros,” check that you’re on the record page for a supported object. You can’t run macros on list views. Click + or Create Macro . Enter a name, description, folder, and select the object that the macro applies to. Click Save . Click Edit Instructions , which opens the Macro Builder. The first instruction is added based on the object that you selected in the Apply To field. Click Add Logic . An Expression Logic pane opens with an IF block. To add ELSE IF or ELSE blocks, use the Expression Logic dropdown menu (1). You can add multiple ELSE IF blocks after the IF block. For each IF or ELSE IF block, configure conditions and instructions. Optionally, add an ELSE block with instructions for when the IF and ELSE IF conditions aren’t met. To add a description that helps agents understand the expression, use the dropdown menu near the block title (2). Select when to take action (3). If your expression uses AND between conditions, select All Conditions Are Met . For example, take action when condition A is true AND condition B is true. If your expression uses OR, select Any Conditions Are Met . To add a condition, click Add Condition . To add a group of conditions, click Add Group . You can add up to 30 conditions or groups in your expression. When you add a group of conditions, a gray block (4) outlines the grouping. For each group, select when to take action. Define each condition using a field, an operator, and an optional comparison value (5). To compare a field to a value, use the operator EQUALS, DOES NOT EQUAL, CONTAINS, or DOES NOT CONTAIN. For example, Status EQUALS New is a condition for the case object. Note The Macro Builder shows you the fields that you can use in a condition. Not all fields on every object are available. Continue to add conditions, condition groups, blocks, and expressions as necessary. You can nest conditions too. Tip If you nest conditions, we recommend that you limit nesting to three levels. Otherwise, the logic can be hard to understand when viewing or editing the macro. In addition, the more complex your logic, the longer it takes to evaluate conditions when you run your macro. In each block, click Add Instruction , and add the instructions that execute when the conditions are met. When you’re done with your macro, click Save . To return to the app, close the Macro Builder tab. Tip After you create a macro with logic, run it to make sure that it works the way you want. Open the Macro utility, and test the macro in different conditions. Example You want to create a macro so that agents can easily send an email when they open a new case. The email content varies according to the case priority, which matches the service response type: Gold, Silver, or Bronze. Regardless of the case status or priority, if the case is an SLA violation, the Gold level email is sent. Here’s example logic for this macro. IF [(Status equals New AND Priority equals High) OR (SLA Violation equals Yes)] {Send email with 'Case under Review: Gold' content} ELSE IF (Status equals New AND Priority equals Medium) {Send email with 'Case under Review: Silver' content} ELSE IF (Status equals New AND Priority equals Low) {Send email with 'Case under Review: Bronze' content} In the IF block, a condition group defines the order in which multiple conditions are evaluated.

They also don’t support logical expressions that control instruction execution. To create this example macro, the Email Publisher must be enabled in your Salesforce org. Create a macro. In the Salesforce for Service Console, click the Macros widget. Click + Create Macros . For Macro Name, enter a name that makes it easy to understand what this macro does. For example, Replace email subject with “Steps for Resetting Your Password” . For Description, explain the purpose for this macro. The optional Description field helps support agents understand what this macro does and distinguish it from similar macros. Add the instructions for the macro. Select a context for the macro. The context specifies the part of case feed that the macro interacts with. For example, selecting Select Active Tab tells the macro that it’s performing an action on the active case tab in Case Feed. Click Done . After every instruction, click Done to move to the next line. Select the object that the macro interacts with. For example, selecting Select Email Action tells the macro to interact with the Email Publisher in Case Feed. Select the action that you want the macro to perform. For example, suppose that you want to replace the subject line of an email in the case, so you select Replace Subject . This instruction tells the macro to change the subject field in the email. It also displays a text field, where you can specify the subject that you want to replace. In the text field, enter the subject line. This instruction clears the original subject and replaces it with the value you specified in the macro. For example, you enter Steps for Resetting Your Password in the text field. Suppose the customer’s original email contained the subject “Password Problems.” The agent runs the macro, automatically replacing the original subject with the new subject. To tell the macro to execute these instructions, select Submit Action . Save the macro. If you followed the example, you created a macro that replaces the original subject line in an email in Case Feed with a new subject line. After creating a macro, it’s a good idea to run it to make sure that it works the way you want. To test this macro, go to the Salesforce Console for Service and open a case record. Open the Macros widget. Select and run this macro. Tips for Creating Macros How you name and design your macro can impact its usefulness to support agents.

Keep these tips in mind when creating macros. Available in Salesforce Classic in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Available in Lightning Experience in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions The Macro Name helps support agents decide which macro to use. The name is used when agents search for macros. It’s useful to use a short name (so that agents can see it in the macros list) that succinctly identifies the macro’s purpose. (1) Although Description is optional, it is useful for helping support agents to understand what the macro does. (2) The macro instructions are like a little computer program, so you must tell the macro each step to perform. Each instruction is equivalent to a click that the support agent makes when manually performing the task. The first macro instruction selects the object that the macro acts upon, such as the Active Case Tab. (3) The second macro instruction specifies the context, or component of the Salesforce Console for Service, in which the macro works. For example, the Email Action context allows the macro to set fields and perform actions within the Email Publisher. (4) If a Salesforce Console for Service component isn’t enabled and configured, then you can’t create a macro for it. The third macro instruction specifies the action that the macro performs. For example, the macro in the screenshot changes the value for the CC Address field in an email action in the active case tab. (5) You can add an extra set of instructions in the same context or in a different context. A simple macro just performs one task. Create more complex macros by adding instructions. (6) If you use the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library instead of the Java Development Kit (JDK) library, review and manually update your Salesforce Classic macros that set the date, time, or currency. Otherwise, your macros can fail or introduce errors. Date and Time: Ensure that the date and time format is supported in the ICU library. For example, for the US locale, add a comma in between the date and time. Valid format before ICU library: 01/09/2018 00:00 Valid format after ICU library: 01/09/2018, 00:00 Currency: Ensure that the comma and decimal are valid for your currency. Errors can be introduced if your org’s currency locale is different from your user's locale. See Also Supported Date and Time Formats (ICU) Loading "

Here, select Select Active Case Tab . In Lightning Experience, the first instruction is auto-populated based on the Apply To field. The next instruction tells the macro which action in the Case Feed Publisher to interact with. Here, select Select Email Action . Now, tell the macro what to do in the Email Action. Select Replace Subject . In the text field, specify the subject line. Selecting a Replace instruction clears the existing value in the field, and replaces it with the value specified in the macro. For example, enter Update on Your Order . Suppose that the subject line was Haven’t Received My Order . The macro clears the old subject line and replaces it with Update on Your Order . Add the instructions to tell the macro to replace an email field with a blank value. In this example, we clear the BCC field. Select Replace BCC Addresses . Leave the text field empty. Selecting a Replace instruction and leaving the text field empty clears the values in the field, so you end up with a blank field. Add the instructions to tell the macro to insert values into a field. In this example, we add two email addresses to the CC field. Select Add CC Addresses . In the text field, specify the email addresses. You can specify multiple email addresses by separating them with a comma. For example, enter shipping@example.com, invoices@example.com . Suppose that the CC field already contains support@example.com . This macro appends the shipping@example.com and invoices@example.com after support@example.com . Select Submit Action .

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions General Considerations Important Macros created in Salesforce Classic display in the macro utility in Lightning Experience only when their object and macro instructions are supported in Lightning Experience. For example, a macro created in Salesforce Classic that attaches a Knowledge article to a case email doesn’t display in the macro utility in Lightning Experience because that action isn’t supported yet. However, a macro created in Salesforce Classic that uses the Log a Call action on a case does display in the macro utility in Lightning Experience. Likewise, you can’t use macros created in Lightning Experience that include instructions that are only available in Lightning Experience in Salesforce Classic. Macros in Lightning Experience work on all objects that allow quick actions and have a customizable page layout. However, we recommend that you don’t use macros with the following items. Read-only fields Encrypted fields Opportunity products Crew Size field on the Service Crew object Social quick action in the case feed publisher provided with Social Customer Service Limitations for Macros in Lightning Experience: Email message objects (not to be confused with the Email action, because macros work fine there) aren’t supported Knowledge articles can't be inserted into Macros Macros don’t run when launched from a record’s Details tab. Note When you run a macro that sends an email with attachments, the macro fails. A pop-up window asks you to confirm sending the email and attached files. Click the option to avoid showing the pop-up message again. Then rerun the macro to send the email and attachments. Keep the following things in mind when enabling folders for macros. You can enable and disable Share and organize macros in folders , but we recommend that you don’t. After it’s enabled, only switch back if you must. After you enable folders, the Share button on macro records in Salesforce Classic is disabled for records that are assigned to a folder. To create and manage folders, you can also use the Analytics Folder API . Folders for macros aren’t supported in Essentials Edition orgs. Verify that your macro page layout includes the Folder field. After enabling Share and organize macros in folders , you might not see the updated list view that shows folders. To see the updated view, choose a different navigation item and then go back to macros. We recommend that you don’t use split view for macros. After folders are enabled, split view displays the folder list view, which isn’t optimized for split view. The macros browser panel supports up to 2000 macros and folder records. Considerations for Creating and Working with Macros Macros are a standard object. If your org has org-wide public sharing, all macros are shared. If org-wide sharing is private, you can share macros with groups, roles, and users manually. Note You can share only individual macros in Salesforce Classic. In Lightning Experience, you can share macros using a folder. Macros only work with self-related records and don't support components that point to other objects Administrators manage prebuilt macros. If you want your service agents to use these Macros, give them at least read access and share the following folders: Macros folder - Basic Macros Quick Text folder - Sample Quick Texts 2 In most text fields, you can insert up to 4,000 characters. Some text fields, like Text Area, have smaller character limits. If you use quick text in text fields, keep in mind that quick text channels aren’t observed in macros. For example, let’s say you set up quick text to be used only on one channel, such as email. When the quick text is in a macro, it can also be used on actions like Log A Call. You can’t use Salesforce Classic email templates that use Visualforce in macros for Lightning Experience. You can apply more than one email template. For example, you can use the Subject of one email template and the Body of another. If an email template is updated, the macro uses the updated template. Macros that apply Lightning email templates that use Handlebars Merge Language (HML) syntax can't be used in Salesforce Classic. You can attach files to emails in your macro. Keep in mind that Salesforce has two types of attachments: ones uploaded in Salesforce Classic and ones uploaded in Lightning Experience. If the attachment was uploaded in Salesforce Classic, add it to a Salesforce Classic template and then apply that template to the macro. The same applies to Lightning Experience. Add the attachment to a Lightning email template, or click Insert Attachment . Before using macros created with Insert at Cursor actions, remember to initialize the cursor where you want the text added. If not, the macro inserts at the beginning of the field. You can create macros with relative times and dates for Time, Date, and DateTime fields only in Lightning Experience. You can create macros with conditional instructions only in Lightning Experience. These macros use logical expressions that determine which instructions execute. The macros utility doesn’t support pop-out. To use the Close Case macro, go to Support Settings and check Show Closed Statuses in Case Status Field in the Setup page to allow closed statuses in the Case Status field. Macros have a 10-second timeout error. If the instruction is still in progress, feel free to wait or click Retry . Macros support only tab-based actions and aren’t supported in the Dynamic Activity Composer . To use macros, switch to the Tabbed Activity Composer. "

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Agents need help with identifying the humans behind their customer interactions. Individual-Object Linking, which replaces Channel-Object Linking, introduces a Search Individual flow action that associates contacts, leads, person accounts, or employees with an interaction. To help you get started, Salesforce provides three flow templates that link individuals to interactions automatically. Add a template with just a few clicks, or customize it to suit your business needs. You can add the Search Individual flow action to auto-launched flows, Omni-Channel flows, and screen flows. The flow action lets you take advantage of Individual-Object Linking in background processes or processes that accept user input. How It Works The basic premise of each flow template is that it takes an interaction record and runs a search for associated individuals based on an identifier. Let’s look at how that happens with each template. Find Contact Associated with Voice Call. This template uses the end user’s phone number from the voice call record to find contacts associated with a voice call. If the search yields multiple results, the agent can select one. If the search yields no results, the agent can create an associated contact. Find Contact for Associated Case from Email-to-Case. For cases created in Email-to-Case, this template finds all contacts with email addresses that match the inbound email address that resulted in the case. The agent selects the correct contact to link to the case. If the search has no results, the flow tells you so. If you want the flow to search other records, such as leads, person accounts, or employees, edit the Find Matching Contacts flow action. Find Contact Associated with Messaging Session. This template uses a search term or variable of your choice to find contacts associated with a messaging session. Edit the Find Matching Contacts flow action to choose the type of individual you want to search (contact, lead, person account, or employee) and insert your preferred search term or variable. If the search yields multiple results, the agent can select one. If the search yields no results, the agent can create an associated contact. The flow template for Find Contact Associated with Messaging Session looks like this. The other flow templates are similar. Why Salesforce Uses Flows for Linking Channel-Object Linking offered a way to associate contact records to voice calls, web chat sessions, and messaging sessions in standard Facebook and WhatsApp channels. But as channel interactions evolve and modernize, Salesforce customers want more flexibility. For example, some sales and marketing-focused customers want to represent an individual using a lead record. So the new Individual-Object linking flow template lets you search leads, employees, and person accounts in addition to contacts. Digital engagement customers want to use this feature for Facebook and WhatsApp. Service Cloud customers want to use it for Email-to-Case. Building Individual-Object Linking into flows lets you map individuals to interactions in every channel. Some customers want control over the search query and how data is created. Flow Builder lets you do something as simple as customize a search term or as complex as using HTTP callouts to search external sources. Businesses that use Salesforce Data Cloud can match end users to support cases and give Service Cloud agents context that improves the support experience. In summary, customers want flexibility in how they identify the human at the end of the interaction. That’s what Individual-Object Linking delivers. Create a Flow to Link Voice Callers to Records To improve service and data quality, add a screen flow that guides agents to find and link callers to leads, contacts, or employees. Create a Flow to Link Contacts to Cases To improve service quality, add a flow that finds contacts for cases created by Email-to-Case. Use the flow template Find Contact for Associated Case from Email-to-Case. Create a Flow to Link Individuals to Messaging Sessions Learn more about the person you’re messaging with. Use a flow template to auto-link contacts, leads, employees, or person accounts to your messaging session. Channel-Object Linking (Beta) Channel-Object Linking is a legacy tool that links contact records to phone calls, web chat sessions, and messaging sessions in standard Facebook and WhatsApp channels.

From Service Setup, enter Channel-Object in the Quick Find box, and select Channel-Object Linking . From the Channel-Object Linking setup page, click New Linking Rule . What Does This Flow Do? This flow lets you create rules to link channel interactions to objects, such as contacts. After you select the channel type (for example, Facebook Messenger, Text, WhatsApp, Phone, etc.) and the object type to link to (for example, Contact), then you can define the linking logic. The logic is different depending on how many matches are found. If no matches are found, you can either have the rule automatically create and link a record, or prompt the agent to search for or create a record. If a single matching record is found, you can either have the rule automatically link the record, or prompt the agent to pick the suggested record, search for a record, or create a record. If there are multiple matches, the system always prompts the agent to pick from a list of suggested records, search for a record, or create a record. Matches are determined on a channel-by-channel basis using the following information.

Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer editions with Service Cloud or Sales Cloud. Important Check out Individual-Object Linking for a modernized, flexible solution. Individual-Object Linking associates lead, contact, employee, and person account records to voice calls, cases from Email-to-Case, and messaging sessions in all channels. For example, let’s say you create a rule for text messages that links conversations to contact records. And you specify that the link occurs automatically when there’s one match. If an agent speaks with someone at a phone number matching a contact’s number, the agent’s notified that the conversation is linked automatically to that contact. The agent can review the changes and optionally cancel the new link. The following table describes all the possible scenarios and the default behavior for each scenario. Matches Found Linking Logic (Specified During Rule Setup) Default Behavior Additional Options 0 Create Record and Link Record is automatically created and linked to channel interaction. Agent can link to a different record or unlink the auto-linked record. Prompt Agent Agent is prompted to search for or create a record to link to. Agent can cancel the action. 1 Auto-Link Record Record is automatically linked to channel interaction. Agent can link to a different record or unlink the auto-linked record. Prompt Agent Agent is prompted with the suggested record and can search for, or create, a different record to link to. Agent can cancel the action. 2 or more N/A Agent is prompted with the suggested records and can search for, or create, a different record to link to. Agent can cancel the action. The matching logic looks for contact records where the value in the phone number field corresponds to most of the digits in the caller’s phone number. It ignores the country code and matches the remaining digits. For example, suppose that a customer with the US phone number 415-555-1234 calls your contact center. Your org has three contact records for this customer, and each record has a variant of the customer’s phone number: Contact record 1’s phone number is 415-555-1234. Contact record 2’s phone number is 1-415-555-1234. Contact record 3’s phone number is +1 415-555-1234. The matching logic recognizes that these records match the caller’s number, so it suggests them as matches and prompts the agent to link the call to the contact record. When a contact is matched with a Voice Call record, the Caller field or the Recipient field on the Voice Call record is updated depending on the call type. For inbound and transferred calls, the caller field is updated. For outbound and returned calls, the recipient field is updated. "

Available in: Salesforce Classic, Lightning Experience Available with these telephony models: Service Cloud Voice with Partner Telephony Partners can enable Conversation Intelligence to ingest intelligence signals from external systems. To get authorization to bring in signals from a new intelligence signal source, partners can reach out to their Salesforce account executives. Then, they can create an Apex class that specifies the intelligence signal source and all supported signal types. Finally, they can package that Apex class in a managed package, which Service Cloud Voice customers, like you, can deploy to their Salesforce orgs. After you deploy the managed package to your org, the new intelligence signal source and signal types are available for selection when you create a Conversation Intelligence rule.

Service Cloud Voice offers multiple options for creating rules. Salesforce admins can declaratively set up Conversation Intelligence rules in a user interface. Developers can set up rules in custom components using Toolkit API and custom actions. The declarative method is the easiest way to set up rules. But the Toolkit API method allows you to develop custom rules and signal detection processes. For example, use Toolkit API to detect signals in the call transcript without using your telephony system. Create a Conversation Intelligence Rule to Trigger an Action To subscribe to intelligence signals defined in your telephony system and trigger actions based on those signals, create a rule based on a Next Best Action or autolaunched flow. For example, create an action that recommends that the agent offer a discount if the customer asks to cancel the service due to a poor customer experience. To create the rule for this example, pass the detected signal to a Recommendation Strategy flow and link the flow to the Einstein Next Best Action component in a Lightning page. Create a Custom Component to Trigger an Action To subscribe to intelligence signals defined in your telephony system and trigger actions based on those signals, create Aura custom components in Salesforce.

For example, create an action that recommends that the agent offer a discount if the customer asks to cancel the service due to a poor customer experience. To create a custom component, pass the detected signal to a Recommendation Strategy flow and link the flow to the Einstein Next Best Action component in a Lightning page. Let’s look at an example where you create a custom component called Voice Intelligence Tester (ConversationIntelligenceTester.cmp). Create the custom component. This custom component subscribes to Service Cloud Voice Aura Toolkit API. <aura:component implements=""flexipage:availableForAllPageTypes,flexipage:availableForRecordHome,force:hasRecordId"" access=""global"" > <!-- Subscribe to Service Cloud Voice Toolkit API --> <force:serviceCloudVoiceToolkitApi aura:id=""voiceToolkitApi""/> <force:recordData recordId=""{!v.recordId}"" layoutType=""FULL"" targetFields=""{!v.record}"" fields=""VendorCallKey""/> <aura:handler name=""init"" value=""{!this}"" action=""{!c.onInit}""/> <aura:handler name=""destroy"" value=""{!this}"" action=""{!c.onDestroy}""/> <!-- Get record data --> <aura:attribute name=""record"" type=""Object""/> </aura:component> Important When you create a custom component, Conversation Intelligence supports using only Service Cloud Voice Aura Toolkit API, not Service Cloud Voice Lightning Web Component Toolkit API. Create the controller resource (ConversationIntelligenceTesterController.js). This resource subscribes and listens to signals defined in your telephony system rules. ({ onInit: function(cmp, event, helper) { helper.subscribeToVoiceToolkit(cmp); }, onDestroy: function(cmp, event, helper) { helper.unsubscribeFromVoiceToolkit(cmp); } }) Create the helper resource (ConversationIntelligenceTesterHelper.js). This resource listens for the new Toolkit API conversation event, INTELLIGENCE_SIGNAL, processes each detected signal, and triggers the next best action (NBA) based on the category name defined in your telephony system rule. In this example, it triggers the next best action if the category name is CustomerAttritionRiskWithNegSentiment. Important Ensure that the payload attribute name of the updateNextBestActions method matches the input variable label in the Recommendation Strategy flow. In this example, the attribute is category. ({ subscribeToVoiceToolkit: function(cmp) { // Subscribe to the INTELLIGENCE_SIGNAL event type cmp._signalEventListener = $A.getCallback(this.signalEventListener.bind(this, cmp)); cmp.find('voiceToolkitApi').addConversationEventListener('INTELLIGENCE_SIGNAL', cmp._signalEventListener); }, unsubscribeFromVoiceToolkit: function(cmp) { cmp.find('voiceToolkitApi').removeConversationEventListener('INTELLIGENCE_SIGNAL', cmp._signalEventListener); }, signalEventListener: function(cmp, signal) { this.processIntent(cmp, signal); }, processIntent: function(cmp, signal) { var data = cmp.get('v.data'); var events = signal.detail.events; for (var i = 0; i < events.length; i++) { var category = {}; category.category = events[i].value; category.service = events[i].service // Filter the signal and decide the action // CustomerAttritionRiskWithNegSentiment is a category value // defined in the Amazon Connect rule if (events[i].value === 'CustomerAttritionRiskWithNegSentiment') { this.triggerNBA(cmp, events[i].value); } } }, triggerNBA: function(cmp, value) { var params ={ category: [value] }; cmp.find('voiceToolkitApi').updateNextBestActions(cmp.get('v.recordId'), params); } }) See Also Lightning Aura Components Developer Guide: Configure Components for Lightning Pages and the Lightning App Builder Service Cloud Voice Implementation Guide: Service Cloud Voice Aura Toolkit API Conversation Events "

Omni-Channel routes work requests to the most available support agents in your Lightning console. And with skills-based routing, your contact center can route work to the agents who are the best fit for the job. In Swarming, these tools work together to ensure that collaboration requests go to the experts best equipped to resolve them.

With Swarming, your agents can use presence statuses to enhance the skills-based swarm requests sent through Expert Finder. You can use permission sets to extend agents’ functional access without making any lasting changes to their profiles. Agents need two presence statuses for swarming. Available If you have multiple channels available such as Swarm Request, Available-Case, this status can be specific to a particular channel. Or it can be a single status that groups multiple channels such as Available for all channels. Busy This status always applies to all available channels unless otherwise specified.

General Swarming Limitations The workspace selector in Begin Swarming shows the workspaces connected to the org, even if the user doesn’t have access to it. Swarming isn’t supported for Essentials editions. User-cloned flows may not have all the latest Swarming and Service Cloud for Slack features. To get the newest features and updates, use the original flows. A Swarm record can’t be owned by a queue. If you start a swarm from Slack, the Swarm Description field holds up to 625 characters. However, when posted to a Slack channel, only 255 characters show. The field’s full 625 characters are still recorded on the swarm record in Salesforce. If you start a swarm from a flow in Salesforce, the Swarm Description limit is 255. If you manually create a Swarm record in Salesforce, the Swarm Description limit is 32,000 characters. Swarming with Slack To let users join a swarm in Slack, make sure the swarm members meet the following conditions. The swarm member must be a Service Cloud user. The swarm member must have connected their Salesforce account to the Service Cloud for Slack app. The swarm member must belong to the same Slack workspace as the swarm requester. To add a swarm member via Expert Finder, the Salesforce org must have the Agent Work Trigger flow cloned and activated, and Omni-Channel must be enabled. If you had the Service Cloud for Slack app installed before the Summer ’23 release, to send an invite email to join a Slack channel for users outside of the channel’s workspace, you must reinstall the Service Cloud for Slack app. In Slack, from the Service Cloud for Slack app, go to the About tab. Click Configuration . From the app’s Slack App Directory page, click Remove App . Then, readd the app to your Slack workspace. Anyone in the Slack workspace can access public channels from the channel selector when you begin swarming in an existing channel. You can mention Slack user groups to add its members to a swarm channel, but you can’t add user groups as swarm members when finishing the swarm. When starting a swarm in an existing channel, the channel selector lets you choose from only the first 1,000 public and private channels where you’re a member of the channel. See Considerations for the Slack Conversations Component Knowledge article drafts in Slack support messages of up to 2,500 characters for English. Other languages may have different character limits. The Slack message is truncated at the character limit. A user that selects View in Salesforce for a record in Slack is taken out of Slack and over to the record in Salesforce. You can search and edit only Salesforce account, contact, case, and Customer Service Incident Management records in Slack. You can create only Salesforce cases, knowledge article drafts, and Customer Service Incident Management records from Slack. You can search for in Slack a minimum of three characters and a maximum of 100. Rich text, images, videos, attachments, and emoji aren’t supported when creating a knowledge article draft in Slack. When creating a knowledge article draft from Slack, you can’t map the Slack Message and Slack Metadata to the same Knowledge field. Only users with Knowledge creation permissions in Salesforce can create a knowledge article from Slack. For Slack channels with multiple swarms, the list of swarm members can’t be shown when the /service-swarm-close slash command is used. To see the swarm’s members, click the swarm’s Finish Swarming button. "

Case Incident Definition A case is one-off customer feedback or a question such as an order delay or escalation that a customer service agent handles. An incident is a disruption that involves many customers. Incidents often begin as an influx of cases related to widespread disruption. Incidents are best used to resolve customer issues that require teams to collaborate. Handled By Customer Service Agent Customer Service Agent and Service Operations Incident Managers IT Support Key Difference Cases are resolved by customer service agents through one-on-one customer interactions. Incidents are multi-customer issues resolved through cross-team collaboration. Relationship Many cases to one incident One incident to many cases Life Cycle Use a case to track a customer issue, from request to resolution. Use an incident for a service disruption. To diagnose an issue and resolve it, use problems and change requests. Creation Flow A customer or agent creates a case via email, chat, or phone.

Available in: Lightning Experience with your standard Service Cloud license Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions The incident manager looks at new and open cases and sees dozens of cases about a malfunctioning discount code. The incident manager creates an incident record. The incident record contains info about the discount code errors, which service territories are impacted, and the urgency level. To track related cases while the incident is investigated and to remove incident-related issues from agent queues, the incident manager links cases from the Case Related Issues related list. A member of the incident resolution team is assigned the incident via Omni-Channel based on their expertise in discount code issues. The incident owner launches the Change Case Owner to Incident Owner flows from the Actions & Recommendations component so that all linked cases now belong to them. Previous case owners can now go back to fielding new customer cases and aren’t distracted by cases related to the incident. The incident owner searches for relevant knowledge articles in the Knowledge component, but they can’t find any known workarounds. The incident owner decides to start a swarm in Slack with other subject matter experts using the Begin Swarming flow and Expert Finder. As a team, the discount code experts work together in the swarm to localize the issue, identify all impacted customers, and invite DevOps team members to collaborate on the resolution. A member of the DevOps team creates a problem record in Salesforce to capture the problem details and investigate the root cause. The DevOps team gets to work debugging the issue, identifies impacted assets, and links the problem to the incident so that the incident owner can keep customers informed. The incident owner adds a broadcast banner to the Take-Out site to alert authenticated users about the incident and to offer an alternate discount code to prevent further cases. As soon as the DevOps team identifies the bug that’s causing the discount code errors, a team member creates a change request to capture the steps to resolution. From the change request, a DevOps member creates a work plan to outline the steps required to resolve the incident and restore the discount code. After all the steps are completed and verified, the incident response team launches an approval flow to get sign-off for the emergency fix from the Change Advisory Board. After the fix is approved and the incident resolved, the incident team launches the Close Change Request & Related Issues flow from the Actions & Recommendations component. The flow automatically closes the change request and its related problem, incident, and cases. The incident owner removes the banner from the Take-Out site and sends a broadcast email to all impacted customers to let them know that the discount code is working again. The incident owner closes the swarm, and the team celebrates their quick thinking and collaboration in Slack. "

Flow Limits and Considerations The Run Flows user permission is required for the running user. To use a Customer Service Incident Management flow, Incident Management must be enabled. Change Case Owner to Incident Owner flow works only on incidents. Close Change Request & Related Issues flow works only on change requests. Close Change Request & Related Issues flow closes only the change request and its related cases, problems, and incidents. If the Closed picklist value is removed from the Change Request Status field, the Close Change Request & Related Issues flow fails. Change Case Owner to Incident Owner flow works only if cases are marked as related to an incident. Customer Service Incident Management flows work only in components or Lightning pages that specify a record ID. For example, you can’t use a Customer Service Incident Management flow from an Experience Cloud side or from the utility bar. Close Change Request & Related Issues flow doesn’t support partial updates. For example, if the running user doesn’t have access to at least one related issue, the flow fails. For Change Case Owner to Incident Owner flow, the case owner can be changed only if the running user has access to the case. A flow can fail due to a trigger or validation error. Check whether any records related to the flow have validation errors. For Change Case Owner to Incident Owner flow, the case owner can be changed only if the incident owner is a User. Loading "

General Considerations You can have up to 100 broadcast topics with a Broadcast Reason of Incident Communication. Broadcast Alerts To send broadcast alerts, grant incident managers the Run Flows permission. To send broadcast alerts to groups, you can assign a broadcast topic to only public groups and queues. If the broadcast topic is assigned to a queue, the user sending the broadcast alert must belong to the assigned queue. A broadcast alert can be sent to a maximum of 10,000 users at one time. If the limit is exceeded, remove assigned groups from the desired broadcast topic. The Incident Alerts All tab’s All Incidents default list view can take up to 48 hours to be created in your org. Users can see an error in the interim. Custom list views added to the Incident Alerts All tab must be based on Incident, and must be public or shared. If a user adds a custom field to the Incident Alerts All tab list view or updates the Incident object, pressing the Refresh button in the Incident Alerts utility doesn’t show the change. To see changes at the object level from the utility, refresh the browser. If a list view is added to the Incident Alerts All tab, it can’t be deleted. To delete it, first change the All tab list view. The Incident Alerts All tab list view shows changes in sorting to the list view upon browser refresh only. If the Incident Alerts All tab list view is updated, the browser must be refreshed. Broadcast Emails Broadcast emails with a contact list created from related cases or products have the same mass email daily send limit as list emails. This limit is typically 5,000 email recipients per day. To increase the broadcast email send limit up to a maximum of 10,000 recipients, contact Salesforce Customer Support. To send emails to more than 10,000 related contacts, create a custom contact list view. To send a broadcast email, users must have Read access to Contacts. To send a broadcast email to related case contacts, at least one case with a contact must be related to the incident. To send a broadcast email to related product contacts, the incident must relate to at least one asset with a product and contact or an account with a primary contact. To send a broadcast email to related product contacts, the product must be active. To send a broadcast email to a product’s Account primary member, users must have the “Allow users to relate a contact to multiple accounts” setting enabled. To relate an asset to the incident or to see the Related Assets or Products related list, users must have at least Read access to Assets. To relate a product to the incident or to see the Related Assets or Products related list, users must have at least Read access to Products. If a product without an asset is related to an incident, the Related Assets or Products related list Asset column is left blank. If a user doesn’t have access to Assets, the Related Assets or Products related list Asset column and record number are hidden. If a user doesn’t have access to Products, the Related Assets or Products related list Product column and record number are hidden. If a product with an associated asset is related to an incident, only the Product column is populated in the Related Assets or Products related list. Broadcast Slack Messages To send broadcast Slack messages, grant users the Run Flows and Send Custom Notifications permissions. You can assign a broadcast topic to only one Slack channel at a time. To assign a broadcast topic to multiple Slack channels, repeat the process. To send broadcast Slack messages, you can assign a broadcast topic to only public channels. Sending a broadcast Slack message shares incident record information with all channel members, regardless of their Salesforce permissions. You can send a broadcast Slack message to only the channels that you’re a member of. Broadcast Slack messages are sent in the language of the user who sends it. Users can select a broadcast Slack message template under certain conditions. There must be at least one custom notification type that’s based on Incident and uses the Service Cloud for Slack app. The person executing the flow must have access to this custom notification type. Slack supports a broadcast Slack message with a title of up to 150 characters and a body of up to 3,000 characters for custom templates. If a custom broadcast Slack message template contains merge fields where the populated data exceeds those limits, an error occurs. If a broadcast Slack message fails to update or delete for one of multiple associated Slack channels, the action can’t be completed. Broadcast Slack messages can’t be deleted or updated if the message was already deleted or it previously failed to send, update, or delete. A broadcast Slack message preview for custom templates doesn’t always match the final message sent in Slack. For example, Slack markdowns can differ and custom template buttons don’t appear in the preview message. Broadcast Site Banners To add broadcast site banners, grant users the Run Flows permission. To add a broadcast site banner, the running user must be a member of the banner’s Experience Cloud site. To let users see an Experience Cloud site’s broadcast site banner, set the Broadcast Communication Audience sharing default to Public Read Only. See Set Your Internal Organization-Wide Sharing Defaults Site visitors can view the broadcast site banner if their Experience Cloud user license supports Cases. The following user licenses are supported for broadcast site banner viewing.

Your Salesforce Knowledge base is built from knowledge articles, which are documents of information. Articles can include information on process, like how to reset your product to its defaults, or frequently asked questions, like how much storage your product supports. Experienced service agents and internal writers write the articles. The articles are then published and can be used internally or externally in a range of channels. You can publish articles in customer and partner sites and public websites or share articles in social posts and emails. Control where and what information is published or shared based on the article page layouts, user profiles, actions, and other settings. You can use Knowledge in both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. Orgs new to Knowledge use Lightning Knowledge, which is generally available. If your org already uses Knowledge in Salesforce Classic, consider using the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool and switching to Lightning Knowledge. Note Enabling Lightning Knowledge changes your org's data model to use record types rather than article types. After you enable Lightning Knowledge, you can't disable it.

Salesforce Knowledge is ""KCS Verified"" by the Consortium for Service Innovation, which recognizes best practices in customer support methodologies. By implementing Knowledge-Centered Support (KCS) features, you can create more efficient collaboration within your team and provide pertinent and accurate information to your customers. Consider the following tips when planning and using Salesforce Knowledge: Create synonym groups in Salesforce Knowledge. Synonyms are words or phrases that are treated as equivalent in article searches, letting you optimize search results. Before setting up data categories, carefully plan your category groups and their hierarchies. Also, consider how your category hierarchy maps to your role hierarchy. For more information, see Data Category Visibility . Create custom reports on your Salesforce Knowledge data. You can also install the Knowledge Base Dashboards and Reports app from the AppExchange to receive over two dozen helpful reports. Multiple agents can edit the same article at the same time. If that occurs, your changes can be overwritten by a colleague without warning, even if you save your work frequently. To avoid accidental data loss, instruct all users who edit articles to edit only the articles they're assigned. Review your usage regularly to avoid storage shortages: from Setup, enter Storage Usage in the Quick Find box, then select Storage Usage . Public knowledge base users cannot rate articles. Salesforce Files allows agents to attach documents to articles. You will lose your data if you convert a custom field on an article type into any other field type. Do not convert custom fields unless no data exists for the field. When renaming Salesforce Knowledge labels note that standard field names, like Title and URL Name, are fixed. You can’t change the labels for these fields on the article create and edit pages. If the organization is set to another language, these fields remain in the fixed label for that language. The Salesforce Knowledge search engine supports lemmatization, which is the process of reducing a word to its root form. With lemmatization, a search can match expanded forms of a search term. For example, a search for running matches items that contain run, running, and ran . Make sure that you have a clear understanding of how record types affect your knowledge base, and how to use them to display different layouts for different articles. For more information, see Record Type Considerations for Lightning Knowledge Determine if you need to create automation for some of your record types. Automation can include quick actions, process builder, or flows. For example, you can create a rule that sends an email to an article manager when an agent creates an article from a closed case. Determine if you need to create approval processes for some of your record types. For example, if you have a type of article that must have legal and management approval before it can be published externally, create an approval process for the article type. For more information, see Workflow and Approvals for Articles . Knowledge Base Allocations by Edition The following table lists the total minimum number of languages, articles, and versions per article permitted for each Salesforce edition by default. Each Salesforce edition also has a default maximum number of languages, articles, and versions per article, as well. You can view the default maximum limits here . For orgs created before the Spring '18 release, the default limit for all editions is 16 languages. To request an extension for these allocations, contact Salesforce support. Note If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Edition Article, Version, and Language Allocations Essentials 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Professional 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Enterprise 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Developer 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Unlimited 150,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 10 languages If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Limits on versions retained per article don’t include versions linked to objects such as cases, work items, and undeletable lookup fields. So, for example, an article might have 25 versions, even if the default limit is 10 versions per article, if 15 of those versions are linked to cases. However, versions attached to objects such as cases count towards the total number of versions per org. "

Help service agents faster by lowering the effort to find the right knowledge at the right place and time. Unified Knowledge works by helping you connect external sources of knowledge to Salesforce. After you choose your sources, Salesforce imports and syncs third-party articles in a read-only format so that you can have a fully integrated knowledge base and search experience in Salesforce. Lightning Knowledge and third-party knowledge sources appear the same in search results for reports, lookup fields, global search, Knowledge list views, the Knowledge component, and Experience Cloud sites. You can filter search results by a field that stores third-party knowledge to distinguish between Lightning Knowledge and third-party content. Salesforce has partnered with Zoomin to offer you this feature. Before you get started, see the Terms and Conditions in Setup. Unified Knowledge is available as a free trial for 90 days. After the trial, buy licenses directly from Zoomin, which will provide you with a custom quote.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Unlimited Edition and other editions with the Knowledge add-on license Read-only Articles, Deletion, and Video Limitations Third-party knowledge that is imported and synced in Salesforce is read-only. You can’t change or update articles from third-party sources in Salesforce. Images from external articles are also stored in Salesforce along with links to embedded videos. Videos are only embedded from approved Salesforce video sites. See Add Videos with the HTML Editor . You can’t use the Salesforce user interface to delete individual, third-party knowledge articles stored in Salesforce. Synchronization between Salesforce and third-party knowledge, along with the publication status of external articles, determines whether they appear in Salesforce. You can delete a configured third-party knowledge connector (with or without its associated articles) from the Unified Knowledge Sources section on the Unified Knowledge page in Setup. We don’t support using <video/> tag to embed videos in knowledge articles. If you use the <video/> tag to embed videos, the video content doesn’t appear in the knowledge article. Article Display and Rendering Limitations Any non-image links from third-party articles display only as text when imported or synced into articles in Salesforce. In the Salesforce mobile app and the Safari browser on iPads, only the first page of PDFs display. Additionally, in the Salesforce mobile app for Android, you’re asked to download PDFs rather than them appearing. If you click the Insert Article on Email, Insert Article into Social Post , or Insert Article into Conversation action on articles imported or synced from PDFs, the text content of the PDF is added to the email without any formatting. See Share Articles in Channels in Lightning Knowledge . Knowledge and Storage Limitations Because third-party knowledge is imported into the Knowledge Article object in Salesforce, it counts towards your org’s Knowledge limits and overall storage limits. The default org limit for articles is 50,000. To increase limits, log a case with Salesforce Customer Support to increase limits. See Knowledge Article Limit Increase Requests . Article Character Limitations When Salesforce imports and converts third-party sources to HTML, which is loaded into a rich text field on Knowledge articles, a maximum of 131,000 characters is allowed on each article. Characters that exceed that limit are excluded from the article. To increase this limit, contact your Salesforce Customer Support and ask about enrolling in the pilot program for Knowledge large content storage. Data Cloud Integration Limitations Unified Knowledge can create a maximum of 200,000 articles each day. See Content Version publication limits. Articles up to 100 MB are generated as Content Documents records, which store articles’ rich text contents. Articles exceeding 25 MB aren't indexed for search.

6392,4,Lightning Knowledge Limitations,knowledge_lightning_limitations_leaf,/s/articleView?id=sf.knowledge_lightning_limitations.htm&language=en_US&type=5,knowledge_lightning_parent_admin_leaf,service_cloud_leaf,support_deflection_leaf,knowledge_whatis_leaf,knowledge_lightning_parent_admin_leaf,knowledge_lightning_limitations_leaf,,,,,Service Cloud,Deflect Cases with Self-Service,Knowledge,Set Up in Lightning Experience,Lightning Knowledge Limitations,,,,,https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.knowledge_lightning_limitations.htm&language=en_US&type=5,"Lightning Knowledge Limitations Welcome to your handy guide to the way things work—or don’t—in Lightning Knowledge. Keep these considerations in mind whether you’re starting fresh or making the switch to Lightning Knowledge. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Knowledge in Lightning Experience works differently than Knowledge in Salesforce Classic. Enabling Lightning Knowledge changes your Salesforce org’s data model to use record types rather than article types. After you enable Lightning Knowledge, you can’t disable it. To move from Classic Knowledge to Lightning Knowledge, use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool. Before running the migration tool in your production org, test the migration in a recently refreshed full-copy sandbox. Verify all customizations and integrations to Knowledge. A carefully prepared migration plan minimizes the impact on production during migration. Important Considerations for Enabling Lightning Knowledge To move your knowledge base from Classic Knowledge into Lightning Knowledge, use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool . Keep in mind that the migration process requires manual steps and verification. It’s possible that some of your data doesn't migrate over. To enable the migration tool in sandbox or production, contact Salesforce support. Permissions and user access work differently in Lightning Knowledge. See Lightning Knowledge User Access . When Lightning Knowledge is enabled, user profile permissions replace article actions with public groups . For Knowledge in Salesforce Classic, you can assign independent object permissions for each article type. In Lightning Knowledge, article types are consolidated in the Knowledge object. You can use sharing for Lightning Knowledge to assign independent permissions based on the record type to user profiles. To delete archived articles in a Lightning Knowledge–enabled org, you must have the Modify All permission. After you enable Lightning Knowledge, the Article Type field is no longer accessible via SOQL or the API, which affects custom code that queries for the ArticleType. Delete any installed packages that contain article types before enabling Lightning Knowledge. Lightning Knowledge doesn't support federated search. Switch to Salesforce Classic. Lookup searches in Classic find Knowledge records (articles) of any Publish status: Draft, Published, or Archive. But in Lightning, Lookup searches find only published Knowledge records. If your org currently has a Visualforce tab named Knowledge, you get an Insufficient Privileges error when trying to access the Knowledge tab in Lightning Knowledge. To avoid this error, rename or delete your existing Visualforce tab or rename your Knowledge object. Files in custom File fields in Salesforce Classic aren’t supported in Lightning Experience. Instead, use the Files related list in Lightning Experience. Use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool to move Files from File fields to the Files object and related lists in Lightning Experience. URL formats for articles differ between Classic and Lightning Knowledge. In Lightning Knowledge, the URL contains the Knowledge Article Version ID and other parameters. In Classic Knowledge, the URL contains the Knowledge Article ID. You can’t use the Public Knowledge Base package (PKB) in Lightning Knowledge. You can share Lightning Knowledge articles in Experience Cloud and Salesforce Sites. Use Help Center to share articles with unauthenticated users. You can have up to 100 links to different Salesforce Knowledge articles in one rich text field. General Usage Limitations for Lightning Knowledge Some authoring actions work differently or aren’t available in Lightning Knowledge. You can’t remove a published article while editing it. Instead, the article remains published while you edit the new version as a draft. You can archive the article to remove it, then restore and edit a draft. Archiving can’t be scheduled for a future date. You can create a Flow to periodically archive articles based on a date field. Articles don't contain a notification when you schedule publication for a future date. You also can’t see a list of articles that are scheduled for publication in Lightning Knowledge, and you can't cancel a scheduled publication. The Printable View action isn't available in Lightning Knowledge. For articles with more than 30 versions, the versions above 30 show in Salesforce Classic but not in Lightning Experience. Data categories don't show in Knowledge list views in Lightning Experience or Salesforce Classic. As a workaround, you can create reports that filter articles by data category. You can see vote information in the ratings component only if there’s a published version of the article. So you can’t see votes for archived articles because no published version exists. When articles are exported for translation, the files attached to them aren’t exported. Files are also not imported as attached Files when Articles translations are reimported after translation is complete. The Tab and Table of Contents article views aren't supported. Hovering on the status of a translation doesn't show related information such as the date submitted. You can't unlock article records that are in an approval process. You can't use macros with Knowledge articles. Before December 2017, when knowledge articles were authored with images in Lightning Experience, only the author could view the images. Other users with Read permission enabled for Knowledge articles didn’t see the images. As of December 2017, the issue was remedied. Photos uploaded from December 2017 forward are visible to all users with Read permission enabled. Photos uploaded before December 2017 must be uploaded again. Star ratings aren’t supported in Lightning Knowledge. Currently, only thumbs up and thumbs down ratings are supported in Lightning Experience. Star ratings in existing Salesforce Classic orgs are automatically converted to thumbs up ratings in Lightning Experience. Ratings of 3, 4, and 5 stars become a thumbs up, and 1 or 2 star ratings become thumbs down. You can't remove a published translation while editing it. Instead, the translation remains published while you edit the new version as a draft. Limitations for Lightning Knowledge with Cases The option to create an article when closing a case is available only in Salesforce Classic. In Lightning Experience, you can create an article from the Knowledge component. You can also create a quick action that makes a draft and maps fields from the case into the new article. Then, you add the quick action to the case layout. Articles created from the Knowledge component don't link to the case automatically. When a case's subject changes, the update must be saved before the suggested article list in the Knowledge component refreshes. The case feed in Lightning Experience doesnt support Knowledge actions. As a workaround, use the actions from the related list of articles or from the suggested articles list in the Knowledge component. Actions don't show if the related list is in a narrow column, but you can click View All. The action that attaches a PDF of an article to a case email isn’t available in the Knowledge component in Lightning Experience. Console Limitations for Lightning Knowledge The Knowledge footer isn’t in the Lightning Service Console. Instead, add the Knowledge component to any object's record home page. You can also create a global action or an object-specific quick action to create a knowledge article from any object. However, suggested articles and related actions are available only with cases. You can't pop out the Knowledge component and drag it to a new screen. Limitations in Salesforce Classic After Enabling Lightning Knowledge These items aren’t available in Salesforce Classic after enabling Lightning Knowledge. Knowledge list views are available only in Lightning Experience. Search for article types isn’t available in Lightning Experience or Salesforce Classic because record types replace article types. Setting a default record type for new articles. The default setting works in Lightning Knowledge. In Salesforce Classic, users can change the record type manually. Filtering a search by Knowledge record types is available only in Lightning Experience. Filtering a search by Archived Articles is available only in Lightning Experience (except through Article Management, which is available in Salesforce Classic only). Files in the Files related list in Lightning Experience aren’t displayed in Salesforce Classic. The following items aren’t available on the Knowledge article record page in Salesforce Classic: Page layout selections for actions and related lists Two-column page layouts Some actions, such as Change Record Type Picklist values assigned to only one record type in Knowledge objects aren’t visible on records in Salesforce Classic. Limitations for Using Lightning Knowledge with Other Salesforce Products Knowledge articles can’t be inserted into macros. If you use Salesforce for Android or iOS, recent articles aren’t displayed on object home. Because Title and URL Name fields are required, you can't remove them from a page layout. Experience Cloud sites use page layouts to display Lightning Knowledge articles, so you can’t remove required fields from Experience Cloud sites. Loading "

They apply to the Knowledge article editor and the docked and case feed email composers in Email-to-Case. General Considerations When pasting content into the Lightning Editor with Remove Formatting enabled, the editor removes the formatting and styling from the pasted text but maintains the underlying semantic markup and content structure. For example, a <b> (Bold) tag found in the HTML document is retained in the final pasted content even with Remove Formatting selected. Similarly, a style addition such as text-decoration: underline is removed from the pasted content upon selecting Remove Formatting . Unlike the previous Knowledge Article Editor, the Lightning Article Editor hasn't been translated into the following languages. But you can still use the Lightning Article Editor to create articles for these languages. Afrikaans Albanian Basque Bosnian Bengali Catalan English (Australia) English (Canada) Estonian Farsi French (Canada) Georgian German (Switzerland) Gujarati Hindi Icelandic Khmer Latvian Lithuanian Macedonian Malay Serbian (Cyrillic) Serbian (Latin) Welsh Collapsible and expandable headings created in the Lightning editor aren’t shown when you view the knowledge article on an Experience Cloud site or insert the article into an email. Additionally, the accordion structure doesn’t display in the preview panel of the Knowledge article. The Lightning Editor is supported in Lightning Experience only. You can enable it for the Knowledge article editor or for the docked and case feed email composers in Email-to-Case through separate release updates. If you created articles or emails with the previous editor, they’re compatible with the Lightning Editor. Enabling the Lightning Editor doesn’t change the look and feel of the content that you created with the previous editor. Note Content created in the Lightning Editor isn’t fully backward-compatible because the Lightning Editor includes features that aren’t in the previous editor. If you compose articles or emails with the Lightning Editor and then revert to using the previous editor, you can see style, content, or formatting issues. To copy and paste web images into the editor, you must add the source as a Trusted URL . For example, for Google Docs, add *.googleusercontent.com as the URL and select the img-src (images) Content Security Policy (CSP) directive. If you don’t add the external source to your trusted URLs or the image is too large, you get an error. To paste images from Google Docs that reside on a Salesforce server into the editor, enable the Allow site for connect-src setting . Otherwise, the image is pasted as an external URL. In the Lightning Editor, the way you work with images, anchors, and links differ. When you edit Knowledge articles, how you work with smart links also differs. You can’t double-click these elements. Instead, right-click an element and select an action from the context menu. Or select the element and then click the relevant icon from the menu bar. Unlike the previous Knowledge Article Editor, the Lightning Article Editor doesn’t generate unique URLs to anchors. Consequently, links to anchors direct you to the articles, but not to the specific anchor points in the articles. However, within articles, anchors still direct you to their specific locations. The Lightning Editor resizes the window vertically as you add lines of text. With the previous editor, the window size remains the same. You can enter Control-Right Click to check spelling in emails and Knowledge articles as you compose them. In the previous editor, you used Control-Click . The Lightning Editor supports only some keyboard shortcuts available in the previous editor. Here are the keyboard shortcuts that the Lightning Editor supports. Keyboard Shortcut Support Action Shortcut on Windows Shortcut on Mac Bold Ctrl+B Cmd+B Italic Ctrl+I Cmd+I Underline Ctrl+U Cmd+U Select all Ctrl+A Cmd+A Redo Ctrl+Y or Ctrl+Shift+Z Cmd+Y or Cmd+Shift+Z Undo Ctrl+Z Cmd+Z Insert Heading 1 Alt+Shift+1 Ctrl+Opt+1 Insert Heading 2 Alt+Shift+2 Ctrl+Opt+2 Insert Heading 3 Alt+Shift+3 Ctrl+Opt+3 Insert Heading 4 Alt+Shift+4 Ctrl+Opt+4 Insert Heading 5 Alt+Shift+5 Ctrl+Opt+5 Insert Heading 6 Alt+Shift+6 Ctrl+Opt+6 Insert Paragraph Alt+Shift+7 Ctrl+Opt+7 Insert Division Alt+Shift+8 Ctrl+Opt+8 Insert Address Alt+Shift+9 Ctrl +Opt+9 Focus to Menu Bar Alt+F9 Opt+F9 Focus to Toolbar Alt+F10 Opt+F10 Focus to Element Path Alt+F11 Opt+F11 Focus to Contextual Toolbar Ctrl+F9 Ctrl+F9 Print Ctrl+P Cmd+P Open Help Dialog Alt+0 Opt+0 Insert Link (if link plug-in is activated) Ctrl+K Cmd+K Toggle Full Screen Ctrl+Shift+F Cmd+Shift+F Find (if search and replace plug-in activated) Ctrl+F Cmd+F Save Ctrl+S Cmd+S Here are the keyboard shortcuts for search and replace actions supported by the Source Code editor.

The screen reader shows the line number and reads it aloud. The Lightning Editor supports HTML tags not supported by the previous editor. Here’s a full list of the HTML tags the Lightning Editor supports. <a> <dt> <s> <abbr> <em> <samp> <acronym> <font> <small> <address> <h1> <span> <b> <h2> <strike> <bdo> <h3> <strong> <big> <h4> <sub> <blockquote> <h5> <summary> Email Composer doesn’t support the summary tag. <br> <h6> <sup> <caption> <hr> <table> <center> <i> <tbody> <cite> <iframe> <td> <code> <img> <tfoot> <col> <ins> <th> <colgroup> <kbd> <thead> <dd> <li> <tr> <del> <ol> <tt> <details> Email Composer doesn’t support the details tag. <p> <u> <dfn> <pre> <ul> <div> <q> <var> <dl> General Limitations The following message and UI labels from the Lightning Editor aren’t translated. This warning message from the Accessibility Checker: This paragraph looks like a heading. If it is a heading, please select a heading level. The UI labels for the Media option on the Insert menu and the title of the Media window aren’t translated. The UI label for the title of the Special Character window isn’t translated. Embedding videos from sites that Salesforce doesn’t support causes the embedded HTML iframe to be removed when the article or email is saved. To prevent this issue, only embed videos from the approved video sites listed in Add Videos with the HTML Editor . Emoji doesn’t render for recipients of emails where the sending user and/or org haven’t enabled UTF-8 encoding, or where the recipient’s email client doesn’t support UTF-8 encoding. Learn how to update your email encoding. The Insert / Edit Media function in the Lightning Editor doesn’t support URLs of YouTube Live videos captured with the Share Copy URL action provided by YouTube. To insert URLs of YouTube Live videos into the editor from YouTube, right-click the video and select Copy video URL. Then use the Insert / Edit Media function to insert the URL. If you apply a heading to a selected text, it’s sometimes applied to the entire email or article. A workaround is to insert an empty line or space after the selected text. When you’re resizing table rows and columns in the Lightning Editor, the adjusted table height and width CSS styles get applied to every table cell in the table’s source code. The word count in the Lightning Editor differs from the Source Code plug-in because the plug-in counts additional characters like styling tags. Considerations for Knowledge Articles The Lightning Editor doesn’t support searching articles by Knowledge Article Number from the Smart Link window. When a Knowledge article includes a video and you save the article as a PDF, the image of the video shows as an empty place-holder. For Knowledge articles, you can upload images up to 1 MB from your computer. The links to article search results are based on the search filter and not the recently viewed list. The Lightning Editor converts linked text and email addresses into hyperlinks. If you remove those hyperlinks, they aren't included as hyperlinks in the Knowledge record. With the previous editor, links and email addresses are always hyperlinked. When you’re viewing content in Preview mode, all hyperlinks are inactive so that you can’t click and navigate away from the editor. Limitations for Knowledge Articles A known issue causes deactivated Knowledge languages to appear on the language filter in the editor’s Smart Link window. A known issue causes the Create and Edit pop-up windows on the Lightning Editor to be misaligned when using the 1- or 2-column layout on console apps. A known issue causes windows with three-column layouts to be misaligned and partially hidden in the overlay in the Lightning Editor. The issue occurs sporadically and only in the Safari browser when the page layout width is narrow. To avoid the issue, use the Lightning Editor in full-screen layout mode when working in a Safari browser. The Lightning Article Editor doesn’t support pasting content from Microsoft Word OneDrive. Pasting content from the desktop version of Microsoft Word is supported. Considerations and Limitations for Docked and Case Feed Email Composers in Email-to-Case In the docked and case feed email composers, you can insert images up to 5 MB. If the image is smaller than the window, it fits in the window and isn’t expanded. If it’s larger than the window, the image is resized to fit the editor window. You can copy and paste an image into the editor using a keyboard shortcut or drag. When you upload and insert images, thumbnails don’t appear in the upload window as they did in the previous editor.

The File field is not supported on Dynamic Forms. If you use Dynamic Forms to set a filter on the Is Primary Language field and a knowledge article is using that primary language, the filter always returns a value of FALSE if the org is not set up for multi-language support. A known issue prevents setting the following fields as read-only when using Dynamic Forms, but not when using the page layout: Language (the field is writable only when creating a new knowledge article) Visible in Public Knowledge Base Visible in Partner Portal Visible in Customer Portal Page Layout field properties that define whether a field is read-only, required, or neither, are not maintained when upgrading the record page to Dynamic Forms.

Additionally, you can apply custom visibility rules to hide or display fields based on user criteria (fields on the user record), user permission criteria, and record criteria. Service agents interacting with the content can find answers faster because they only see what is relevant to them. Knowledge articles that use the record page from the Lightning App Builder load quicker and are more stable thanks to the Lightning Web Component framework.

Whether it’s a secure customer portal, part of your public site, or integrated into a public customer Experience Cloud site, your knowledge base is an extension of your service website. Enable Lightning Knowledge, choose article authors, and make a few data category groups. Build the momentum by configuring page layouts, record types, and processes. Service Setup is available in Lightning Experience Available in: All editions with the Service Cloud You can embed Lightning Knowledge in the console so that your support agents can easily find, access, and deliver the right answers to customers. Agents can also contribute to the knowledge base, ensuring that the best answers are always accessible to the whole team. Important After you enable Lightning Knowledge, you can’t disable it. Where to Access the Setup Flow This flow is available from Service Setup in Lightning Experience. You can get to Service Setup by clicking the gear icon and selecting Service Setup. In Service Setup, you can find recommended setup flows, content, and tips based on what you’ve set up already. If you don’t see the setup flow you’re looking for, you can click View All to see the full list. Select the tile to launch the flow. What Does This Flow Do? In this setup flow, we walk you through: Enabling Lightning Knowledge Choosing knowledge article authors Creating data categories and data category groups Tip Data Category Groups help you classify and find articles. You can use data categories to control access to a set of articles, questions or ideas. We also turn on several things in the background during the setup flow. Enabling Lightning Knowledge We enable Lightning Knowledge during the flow, which can’t be undone. Don’t worry about this if you’ve never used Knowledge before and you’re ready to dive in on Lightning Experience. Lightning Knowledge is different from Salesforce Knowledge in Salesforce Classic, so if you already use Salesforce Classic, some planning is required. Make sure that you know and understand what changes and what works differently when you switch. Default Page Layouts and Record Types A default FAQ page layout and record type is auto-enabled in the setup flow. The page layout determines how the articles are displayed. By doing this step, you are associating the page layout and record types. After completing the flow, you can go to the Object Manager to create or modify your page layouts. Note If you created a page layout and record type before starting the Lightning Knowledge setup flow, we don’t create new ones in the setup flow. The integrity of your initial settings isn’t altered. Knowledge Permission Sets Your selected authors get full read, write, and publishing access through the Knowledge LSF permission set, and access to the Knowledge Object. The setup flow auto-enables the page layout and record type for these profiles. Everyone whom you designate an author gets a Knowledge User License. The setup flow grants data category visibility to profiles selected on the Choose Author screen. Lightning Knowledge Setup Flow: What’s Next?

Understand the limits of the migration tool and Classic features that either aren’t supported or work differently in Lightning Knowledge. Note The migration and undo migration process can take a few hours or days to complete. To reduce wait times, schedule a migration outside of major Salesforce release dates. Key things to note about the post-migration Lightning Knowledge data structure: Record Types —The migration tool maps Classic Knowledge article types to record types and consolidates fields in one Lightning Knowledge object. Files—Files from custom file fields in Classic Knowledge articles are moved to the standard Files object. After migration, view and attach files in the Files related list. Permissions—User profiles are granted new authoring permissions in user profiles or permission sets, and no longer use article actions with public groups. Note Admins must manually assign permissions. Changing from Article Actions with Public Groups to using profile permissions or permission sets is not part of the migration tool. Let’s compare Classic Knowledge to Lightning Knowledge: Classic Knowledge Versus Lightning Knowledge Feature Classic Knowledge Lightning Knowledge Access & Permissions CRUD per article type Page layouts Authoring permissions with Article Actions per Public Group Unified CRUD Page layouts Authoring permissions on user profiles or permission sets Approvals & Workflow Per article type All record types Per record type Authoring Custom Article Management tab Standard Actions (admin can control in page layout) Data model Custom article types Standard record types File Attachment Custom file fields (5 max) Standard Files component Related list Object Home Article Management tabs Knowledge One Unified standard object home with list views Page layouts Fields only Per article type and user profile Fields, actions, and related lists Per record type and user profile Record Home Custom record home (static) Standard record home (configurable with page layouts and App Builder) Search Custom Knowledge search Standard Search: Knowledge in Global Search Sharing Article access by data category Standard Salesforce sharing also available Validation Rules Per article type All record types Per record type As part of the migration plan, we recommend that Knowledge admins become familiar with all the limitations. Before performing sandbox and production migrations, assess whether these items pertain to your org’s implementation of Knowledge and prepare accordingly. The following items do not migrate from Classic into Lightning Knowledge: Limitations in the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool Item Description Article Number For orgs with multiple article types, article numbers change during migration. Because Article Number is a standard auto-number field, you can’t retain the numbers when migrating to Lightning Knowledge. Article Status The following are removed during migration: Articles with a Scheduled for Publish status and a past due date Articles with a Scheduled for Archive status and a past due date Publish scheduled articles and archive scheduled articles before starting the migration. Automated Article Feed Posts Article Feed Posts that show article changes (published, edited). ContentPublication Due to the ContentPublication limit (how many ContentVersion objects can be created per day), the migration tool supports only orgs with 200,000 or fewer custom files. Contact Salesforce support if your org has more than 200,000 files. ContentVersion , Physical Delete Due to the nature of ContentBody reuse, if an org performs an UNDO, the ContentVersion rows must be physically deleted before migration. Because physical delete runs as a cron job during off hours, the overall UNDO process can take several days. Field Tracking Limits Field histories migrate when field tracking is enabled. If the total number of fields with tracking enabled across all Article Types exceeds the limit, you see an error message, and the migration doesn’t start. To make sure that the total is below the threshold, remove the tracking on some fields , and retry the migration. The default limit for field tracking is 20 fields. If you need to raise this limit, contact your Salesforce representative. Soft Deleted Records Soft-deleted records are not migrated from Classic. Undeployed Article Types Undeployed article types are removed during migration. Deploy article types you need and delete those you don't. URL Redirect After migration, article URLs in these two standard formats redirect to the appropriate article in Lightning Knowledge. https:// mySalesforceDomain / knowledgeArticleId For example, https://cunning-bear.com/kA0RM0000004gTt https:// mySalesforceDomain /articles/ xx__XX / articleTypeName / URLname For example, https://cunning-bear.com/articles/en_US/FAQ/how-to-create-accounts After migration, Smart Links automatically redirect to the correct environment. The URL redirect behavior varies based on the environment. For information about URL redirects, see Target Behavior for Smart Links . Workflow and Approval Processes Approval process history doesn’t migrate to Lightning Knowledge. Metadata That Does Not Migrate from Classic into Lightning Knowledge Metadata Types Description Article Type Metadata CRUD Validation rules Communications channel mappings Field sets Compact layouts Audit trails Feed Tracking Feed Tracking does not migrate to Lightning unless an old article type with feed tracking is enabled. Field Metadata Formula fields Required field flags in the field definition Field-level security Fields Sets Code that uses field sets Customizations based on article types don’t work after migration. In orgs with multiple article types, you must update customizations to use the new knowledge object. Consider these customizations: SOQL that queries the concrete entity name Visualforce pages that refer to old article types Code that uses field sets Apex code that refers to old article types Custom code using API calls referencing article types Customer application logic, such as current API code Some AppExchange packages Validation rules CRUD (per Article Type) Applications that use metadata APIs on field sets, compact layouts, and so forth Reports that point to old article types Important The Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool helps you migrate to Lightning Knowledge, but it doesn’t guarantee that all your data migrates. For instance, corrupt data isn’t migrated, and you might not be aware of which data has minor corruptions. It’s important to verify the migrated data and assess the results during sandbox testing and production migration. Use the migration results report to identify which articles or files didn’t migrate, and assess whether the unmigrated data is blocking the migration. Although your sandbox org might contain corrupt data, your production org data might not be corrupt, or might have different corrupt data. If a record doesn’t load properly in either the Salesforce Classic or Lightning Knowledge interface, it can be due to data corruption. Note You can’t compare the article count from the migration summary page with SOQL results using COUNT() . Because of limitations with Workbench, SOQL queries using COUNT() don't return the same list of articles, article versions, version histories, and vote and view statistics. In orgs with multiple article types, the size of your knowledge base temporarily doubles during migration. Your File and Data storage limits are temporarily doubled when migration starts, and reset when you cancel or accept the migration results. During this period, both the Classic and Lightning Knowledge versions of each article are present in your org. Now that you’ve learned about the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool, it’s time to plan and sandbox test your migration . See Also Sharing Considerations for Lightning Knowledge Loading "

In fact, planning is the most important part of migrating to Lightning Knowledge. Sandbox Testing Before performing a production migration, perform the migration in a sandbox. We strongly recommend testing in a full-copy sandbox. There is a high likelihood of data corruption when a partial-copy sandbox is used. The steps to perform a sandbox migration are the same as a production migration. After planning the migration and reviewing the Pre-Migration Checklist, perform either the Single Article Type migration or Multiple Article Type migration. Tip If you want the option to restore knowledge articles after migration, we recommend creating another dedicated full-copy sandbox for backup. Pre-Migration Checklist Whether you have one or multiple article types in Knowledge, read through the entire checklist before performing the sandbox test. Important Refer to this checklist again when performing your org’s production migration. Article Types When migrating from Classic to Lightning Knowledge, article types are mapped to new record types with the same name as the article types. They map to the API name, not the label name. Perform the following checks before proceeding to migration, and be mindful of these limitations. Deploy undeployed article types that you want to migrate. Identify and hard-delete article types that you don’t need. Change metadata settings in Knowledge article types in Setup. For example, add an article type, remove an article type, change settings on an article type, or change profile access to article types. Change the Default Article Type setting to None . Remove the following dependencies. When the migration tool deactivates old article types, these objects aren’t always deleted, causing the migration to fail. Entities summarized by other entities Report jobs referencing a custom entity definition Article types referenced by the Agent Contribution setting Article types referenced by the Answers Promotion setting Custom objects used by matching rules Article types used by a duplicate rule Managed deletions that point to the article type Article types with non-deletable child custom fields from other managed packages Article types referred to by other features, such as Apex classes or data flows Lightning Knowledge enablement is blocked if any packages created in the current org contain an article type. To enable Lightning Knowledge, remove article types from packages created in the current org. Page Layouts To give your users a great layout experience and access to the appropriate fields, adjust the page layouts. You can assign different page layouts per record type and user profile after the migration. Ensure that they are properly configured during the migration. Before starting the migration, remove page layouts that you don’t need. Field Considerations When mapping fields from multiple article types into one record type, keep these considerations in mind. Formula fields don’t migrate. After migration, create formula fields in the Knowledge object, and revise the formulas to reference the new object. Field dependencies don’t migrate. The migration tool migrates the fields. However, it doesn’t migrate their field dependency settings. Picklists and multi-select picklists only map if they have the same picklist values, the same deactivated values, or the same global picklist. You can’t migrate dependent picklists. The picklist options migrate, but the mapping between them doesn’t. You reset these after migration. Also, default values for picklists and checkboxes don’t migrate to Lightning Knowledge. Tip An org can have two picklist fields, A and B. A is the controlling picklist and B is the dependent picklist. The migration tool migrates both A and B, but they become standalone picklists, and you must redefine their field dependency settings. When mapping fields to other fields, choose the target field from a picklist that establishes which one is the primary field. If field size is reduced before migration but the articles have more characters than before field size reduction, all the text shows in Classic. However, after migration, the field size is truncated in the new object, which means that the additional characters don’t display. For example, if a field with 500 characters is increased to 1,000 in Classic, there can be 1,000 characters in the field, but only 500 of them display in Lightning. Required field flags don’t migrate. Therefore, required fields must be rethought after migration by each org because they all reside in the same table. It is better to manage required fields through page layouts or validation rules, unless they are truly required for all records across all record types. Migrated fields are named “Article Type_Field Name.” This convention removes field name conflicts. Deleted fields (soft-deleted fields that are retained for 30 days) don’t migrate. Customizations and Managed (or Unmanaged) Packages Inspect custom elements before and after the migration to ensure that they moved to the new Knowledge object. Sometimes they break, so prepare to assess this aspect of the org when performing the sandbox migration (before migrating in production). After migration, adjust custom elements that reference an Article Type to point to the new Knowledge object. Uninstall all packages that include an article type. If you don’t uninstall those packages, you can’t enable Lightning Knowledge or start the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool. The Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool doesn't work for the Developer Edition if you define a namespace for packaging. Here are a few examples of customizations to consider in your post-migration assessments. SOQL that queries the concrete entity name Visualforce pages that refer to old article types Code that uses field sets Apex code that refers to old article types Custom code using API calls that references article types Customer application logic such as current API code AppExchange packages Validation Rules CRUD (per Article Type) Applications that use metadata APIs on field sets or compact layouts Important For orgs with multiple article types, update these customizations to reference the new Knowledge object after migration starts and before selecting Accept . If some data didn’t migrate and you want to pause the migration, update these customizations to refer to the old article types before selecting Undo . Otherwise, the new knowledge object isn’t always deleted after undoing the migration. File and Attachment Considerations Files from custom file fields in Classic Knowledge articles are moved to the standard Files object. After migration, users can view and attach files in the Files related list. When the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool runs, you choose the basic visibility setting to apply to the migrated articles. You can choose to make files visible to all users with access to the article, including guest and Experience Cloud users, or only your internal users. If your internal users require access to files that you don't share with external users, you can adjust permissions for individual files after migration. To minimize the effort of setting file access, choose the visibility option that applies to most of your files. Pre-Migration Best Practices and Post-Migration Considerations Mapping—Assemble complex mapping ideas using a spreadsheet or organizational tool. Using a spreadsheet or organizational tool gives you a sense of how to map your knowledge base in Lightning. Tip If you map field A to field B, the first field (A) is no longer an available option. But what if you want to revise your choice? First, unmap the field selection (A to B). Then, assuming they are the same field type, you can map field A to C instead, or map C and B to field A. Use only one level of mapping to avoid cascading. Prepare for Validation—Save or print a few articles in advance so you can compare them afterward and verify a successful migration. Records Owned by Inactive Users—Knowledge article versions (kav) linked to inactive users can cause problems during migration. To successfully migrate articles with inactive owners, the org preference Update Records with Inactive Owners must be enabled. If this setting is disabled in your org, the Migration Tool temporarily enables it during migration. Find the preference in Setup User Interface . Case and answer settings: In Case Settings, under Allow user to create an article from a case, set the default article type to None . In Answer Settings, under Allow users to create an article from a reply set the default article type to None . Maintenance Notice: Stop Knowledge Base Activity During Production Migration To prevent data loss, ensure that your users don’t edit the knowledge base for the duration of the migration. This action is most important for orgs with multiple article types, because migration takes longer and the data model changes significantly. After you begin the migration, it’s important to finish the process as soon as you can. Plan carefully to ensure minimal downtime for knowledge base users. Before performing your production migration, communicate a company-wide bulletin to ensure that all changes to the knowledge base, its structure, and articles stop during migration. However, your users and customers can still read articles during migration. For orgs with multiple article types, the switch to articles in Lightning occurs at the start of the Activation stage. Warning Make sure that no changes are made to any Knowledge content during migration. All revised data is lost or damaged. User and API activity, such as Apex triggers and jobs, can stop migration or lead to corrupted data in some articles and files. Here’s a few examples of activities that must stop during migration. Editing articles Creating articles Changing the publishing status of articles Changing Knowledge setup, including changes to Data Categories API calls that change your Knowledge setup or articles Apex triggers that change or create Knowledge articles Votes on an article Linking to a case Linking to a work order or work order item Adding feed posts, changing feed posts, or following an article Edits to files attached to articles Adding topic mappings to articles in Experience Cloud sites Tip To stop many of the cited activities during migration, remove Create and Edit rights to Knowledge for user profiles other than the admin. Get Ready to Use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool After planning and successfully sandbox testing, contact Salesforce support and tell us you’re ready to perform the migration in your production org. We ask you about the results of your sandbox migration before we enable the tool in production. Do you have a single article type org or a multiple article type org?

Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. User Permissions Needed To use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool: Customize Application AND Knowledge User Note This procedure applies to both sandbox and production migrations. To enable the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool in your production org, log a request with Salesforce Support. Allow 1–2 weeks advance notice from your target migration date. Before we can enable the tool in production, our support team asks a series of questions about your migration plan and the results of your sandbox test. Warning Make sure that no changes are made to any Knowledge content during migration. All revised data is lost or damaged. User and API activity, such as Apex triggers and jobs, can stop migration or lead to corrupted data in some articles and files. Switch to Lightning Experience. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter migration , and then select Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool . To start the migration, follow the on-screen prompts. Note If you receive an error message after beginning the migration, follow the instructions in the message. Then restart the migration. Start migration setup. Review the article types and custom fields that are part of the migration. Map the article fields. Mapping is one of the most important steps in the migration. Tab through each article type, and make your new field selections. Important The migration tool creates a placeholder field called “Article Type_Field Name”, where _Field Name matches the custom field name. To choose alternative field mappings, click a dropdown under New Field. Tip If you have fields of the same type that are common across article types, you can consolidate them in the new object. For example, if multiple article types have a field called Question, you can map all the article types to use the Question field from one article type to reduce duplication. After you map the article fields, tab through each Article Type again. Review your field mappings on each tab, and then go to the next screen. Begin data migration. Follow the on-screen instructions. A confirmation email is sent to you when it’s complete. Tip All users with administrative permissions and the Modify All Data permission receive the confirmation and notification emails. Warning If you create an article, update an existing article, or change any related data during data migration, these changes aren’t migrated. If your migration includes files, you see a screen during migration to set the default visibility. To provide your Experience Cloud users, such as customers, partners, and guest users, access to files, select All users . File visibility is always restricted to users who can access the record where it is attached. You can change the visibility for individual files after migration. To view the migration progress, refresh this page as needed. It can take a few minutes to load the data. When the migration is finished, the Data Migration Summary page appears under Activation. Note Completion time depends on the size of the knowledge base you’re migrating and how many other processes are running at the same time. Feeds and smart links migrate during the Activation step. If at least one existing article type has Feed Tracking enabled, Feed Tracking is turned on automatically for the new Knowledge object. You can cancel or continue the migration at this point. At this stage, no manual changes are required, but you want to verify the migration by validating the old and new Knowledge article IDs before you continue. To finish the activation phase, click Next . In this step, feeds and smart links migrate, the new Knowledge object is activated, and existing article types are deactivated. Important At this point in the migration, make sure that your internal and external users have only read access to articles so that they can't edit articles. In this step, your org switches to using Lightning Knowledge articles. To grant read access to Lightning articles, set up permissions for the new Knowledge object. Note The feed component and feed posts don't appear immediately after migration. After you activate the new Knowledge object, the article’s feed component disappears temporarily while the feed posts migrate. Then the feed component reappears. Under Validation, review the Data Migration Summary. In the example, green check marks next to each item indicate 100% migration. Yellow warning flags (not present in this migration example) appear beside data that didn’t migrate. Note During migration, a results file called LightningKnowledgeMigrationResult Timestamp .txt is generated in the standard Files object. The admin who started the migration owns this file. If all articles and article versions migrate successfully, the file shows a success message. If files or articles fail to migrate, they are reported in the results file. Related data, such as data categories or feeds, isn’t reported in this file. Assess whether unmigrated data is blocking your migration. Validate the results of the Data Migration Summary before you press Cancel or Accept. We strongly recommend that you validate the article migration before accepting the results. Warning Do not update the Knowledge object or the existing article types in the Object Manager before accepting or canceling the migration. If you do, the cancel or accept process stops working. Continue working through the validation steps so that you can cancel or accept the migration as soon as possible. An incomplete migration can mean extra downtime for your users. To validate the migrated components, review the following. Metadata setup—In Setup, go to the Object Manager tab, and scroll down the list to locate Knowledge, which indicates that the migration was successful. In the Object Manager navigation bar, select Fields & Relationships . To verify that fields migrated successfully, review the field labels. Verify the migration of the other Knowledge object details by reviewing Page Layouts, Record Types, and other Setup pages. Data—A tab named Knowledge is created for the new Knowledge object. On this tab, view and validate the migrated articles. Tip We recommend using a selection of pre-existing articles to validate the before-and-after contents. Customizations—Verify that the following entities are updated. No Apex code is referencing the old article types to be deleted. If they are referenced, manually remove the Apex code. Experience Cloud or Salesforce Sites don’t reference the old article types to be deleted. Data flows are not referencing old article types to be deleted. Processes, flows, workflows, or approval processes don’t reference the old data model. In Case Settings, verify that the default article type selected under Allow user to create an article from a case is None . In Answer Settings, verify that the default article type selected under Allow users to create an article from a reply is None . In the Developer Console, search for references to Article Type objects with the __kav suffix. Click the gear icon in the upper-right, and select Developer Console. Click Edit , and then click Search in Files . In the Search field, enter __kav , and click the magnifying glass icon. This returns all instances of Apex code in your org that contain a reference to an Article Type object (*__kav). Update code during the validation period after the Migration Tool is run, but before the changes are accepted. If not, your existing code doesn’t function properly. Verify that all old article types have a deployment status of In Development. Verify that the Knowledge_kav object has a deployment status of Deployed. If the migration tool created the Knowledge__kav object to migrate multiple article types, your new code must reference that object. Also, the code must filter SOQL queries by the appropriate record type ID where necessary. Remember that SOQL queries must filter by record type IDs instead of record type. Record type IDs can be different between sandbox and production, so include code that looks up the ID of the record type by object. Ideally, put this code in a reusable utility class. Verify the migrated articles by comparing the old and new articles in the browser. Use Workbench to query for the new and old IDs. After you validate the results in the Data Migration Summary and find them satisfactory, you can either cancel the migration or accept it and continue. Cancel the migration. To undo the migration, you can cancel it while you investigate any data that did not migrate. Canceling the migration restores the Classic knowledge base with article types and file fields and removes the new Knowledge object created during the migration. To cancel the migration, return to the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool and click Cancel . When restoration is complete, try the migration again. The time it takes to cancel the migration depends on the size of your knowledge base and how many other processes are running. It can take several days or longer. When you cancel, make sure no components reference the new Knowledge object Knowledge__kav. Review the validation checklist in step 14 for which components could be referencing the object. If canceling doesn’t delete the Knowledge__kav object, you receive an email with instructions on how to manually delete the object. When the new object is successfully deleted, the cancellation process automatically resumes. Accept the migration. You performed the validation steps and are satisfied with the migration results. Accepting the migration enables your new Lightning Knowledge org. It deletes the old article types and Classic versions of the articles, including versions that weren’t migrated. After you accept the migration, you can’t undo it. If migration validation is successful, return to the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool, and click Accept . Tip After you accept the migration, the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool no longer appears in Setup. Proceed to the Lightning Knowledge Post-Migration Checklist . Verify Migrated Articles in Multiple Article Type Orgs During Lightning Migration for Multiple Article Type orgs, each knowledge article is given a new ID when it becomes part of the standard Knowledge object. Use the old and new IDs to look at articles and verify that their contents and metadata have migrated properly. We recommend that Multiple Article Type orgs verify articles during the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool’s Activation and Validation stages. "

Tip In Single Article Type migrations, the individual articles aren’t migrated, and the Article ID stays the same. The MigratedToFromArticle column remains empty. Considerations for Verifying Migrated Articles In the Activation stage, Lightning Knowledge is not yet enabled. That means you can only verify the articles in the Salesforce Classic interface until you accept the results and proceed to Validation. The Article Number can change between the old and new knowledge base versions, but other metadata like the last modification date and selected channels matches. To see all versions of a published article in Salesforce Classic, go to Article Management Published Articles , and open an article. In Article Properties, click the Version hyperlink.

In Salesforce Classic, go to the Article Management or Knowledge tab Open each article and locate the Article ID and URL Name fields. Note the values. If you already have the article version ID, you can find the article ID and URL name using the following query. SELECT KnowledgeArticleId , urlname FROM KnowledgeArticleVersion WHERE Id = ‘ YourArticleVersionID ’ Log in to any tool that can make SOQL API calls with your org credentials. To find new or old article IDs, run the appropriate SOQL query. If you’re using the known ID for the old article type, query the KnowledgeArticle object to find the new article ID in the MigratedToFromArticle. SELECT id, MigratedToFromArticle FROM KnowledgeArticle WHERE id = ‘ kA2R00000004N1i ’ If you’re using the new ID for the new Knowledge object, query the KnowledgeArticle object to find the old article ID. SELECT id , MigratedToFromArticle FROM KnowledgeArticle WHERE MigratedToFromArticle = ‘ kA3R00000004JwnKAE ’ Open two browser windows, and log in to your org in each window.

You accepted the results of migration, and you already verified that the new Article IDs open the right articles in Salesforce Classic. Finish the verification process during the Validation stage. The Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool shows the Validation stage and shows the Data Migration Summary page. Check that the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool is in the Validation stage. From Setup, in the quick find box enter migration and select Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool. Refresh the page if necessary. In Salesforce Classic, on the Article Management or Knowledge tab, open the article you want to verify. Locate the new knowledge article ID in the URL. For instance, if your article URL is yourSalesforceDomain /knowledge/publishing/articleOnlineDetail.apexp?id= kA3R00000004Jwu &lang=en_US , the ID is kA3R00000004Jwu . Tip If you created a list of article ID mappings during the Activation stage or you already have the old ID that corresponds to the new article, you can skip this step. To find the old ID, log in to Workbench with your org credentials at workbench.developerforce.com . The following query on the KnowledgeArticle object returns the old ID. SELECT MigratedToFromArticle FROM KnowledgeArticle WHERE Id = ‘ NewArticleID ’ Overwrite the ID in the URL with the corresponding ID from the old knowledge base version. For example, change the URL yourSalesforceDomain /knowledge/publishing/articleOnlineDetail.apexp?id= NewArticleID to yourSalesforceDomain /knowledge/publishing/articleOnlineDetail.apexp?id= OldArticleID To see the pre-migration article, refresh the page. The Type field shows the old article type, not Knowledge. Open the same article in Lightning Experience. In a new browser window, log in to your org and switch to Lightning Experience. From the App Launcher, find and open the Knowledge tab. Open the article with the same name as the one in your other browser window. Tip Try switching to a different list view, like Published Articles or Draft Articles, to find the article. Place the two windows side by side and review them. The article in Salesforce Classic uses the old ID, and the article in Lightning Knowledge shows the new ID (1). The article’s title and other details are the same (2). Review and verify the following items. Note Page layouts differ between the old and new knowledge bases, so the fields don’t always match exactly. If you don’t see related lists, standard fields, or custom fields, verify that they are on the page layout in Lightning Knowledge. To modify the layout, go to Setup Object Manager Knowledge Page Layouts and edit the appropriate layout for the article’s record type. Drag files, cases, or work orders to the Related Lists section, make other desired changes, and save. Item Notes Details Section: Title, URL name, Smart Links, custom fields File fields in the old article don’t appear in Lightning Knowledge. For the new article, files appear in the Files related list. Related lists: cases, work orders, promoted search terms, files Verify that the appropriate records and files appear in related lists like files, cases, and work orders. Feeds Feeds migrate completely to the new object, so you don’t see feeds in the old article after migration. Verify the following feed items in new articles: posts, comments, attachments, mentions, topics, and likes. If you subscribed to the article before migration, you also see Following. Smart Links From an old article, Smart Links go to the old version of the linked article. While viewing an article with the Lightning Knowledge ID, clicking Smart Links directs you to the new version of the article. URL redirects A redirect URL using the old ID, either the KnowledgeArticle (ka) ID or the KnowledgeArticleVersion (kav) ID opens the new article. Loading "

You went over the pre-migration checklist, and you made all the prerequisite revisions to your Classic knowledge base. You’re aware of the limitations. You’re ready to go. Here’s your step-by-step guide to using the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool in orgs with a single article type. and User Permissions Available in: Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. User Permissions Needed To use the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool: Customize Application AND Knowledge User AND Manage Knowledge Note This procedure applies to both sandbox and production migrations. To enable the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool in your production org, log a request with Salesforce Support. Allow 1–2 weeks advance notice from your target migration date. Before we can enable the tool in production, our support team asks a series of questions about your migration plan and the results of your sandbox test. Warning Make sure that no changes are made to any Knowledge content during migration. All revised data is lost or damaged. User and API activity, such as Apex triggers and jobs, can stop migration or lead to corrupted data in some articles and files. Switch to Lightning Experience. From Setup, enter lightning knowledge in the Quick Find box, then select Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool . Follow the on-screen instructions and start the migration. Note If you receive an error message after beginning the migration, follow the instructions in the message, and then restart the migration. Choose whether to create a record type during migration. Warning You can’t change record types on articles with translations after migration. If you don’t assign a record type now, you can’t later add a record type to existing translation records. Begin migration. Follow the on-screen instructions. Completion time depends on the size of your knowledge base and how many other processes are running at the same time. Important You can’t undo the migration or disable Lightning Knowledge after you start the migration. After you migrate, the Lightning Knowledge Migration Tool is no longer available in Setup. (Optional) If your migration includes files, you see a screen during migration to set the default visibility. To provide your Experience Cloud site users, such as customers, partners, and guest users, access to files, select All users . File visibility is always restricted to users who can access the record where it is attached. You can change the visibility for individual files after migration. Note If your migration includes files, you receive a confirmation email when the migration is complete, and a report is created to show the outcome of the file migration. All users with administrative permission and the Modify All Data permission receive the confirmation email. Look for the report file named LightningKnowledgeMigrationResult Timestamp .txt in the standard Files tab. The admin who started the migration owns the report file. If everything migrated, the report shows a success message. The report also lists articles with files that failed to migrate. Proceed to the Lightning Knowledge Post-Migration Checklist . Loading "

Available in: Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Single Article Type Orgs In the Object Manager, do the following. Check the label of the new Knowledge object. If necessary, change it to Knowledge . If you have no customizations, Experience Cloud sites, Salesforce Sites, or Apex code referencing the new object, consider changing the API name, too. Otherwise, change only the label. Validate the new record type. Validate files migration in the Files related list. For All Orgs For page layouts (per record type), inspect each of these elements. Add the fields to page layouts that were hard-coded to the pages in Salesforce Classic. Check how page layouts are associated to record types and user profiles. Add related cases if your agents attach articles to cases. Add files if your org uses File Attachment to articles. Add work orders and work order line items if you use Field Service. Use Approval History if your org uses Approval Processes or Submit for Approval actions. Add actions to the page layouts as needed. Actions show on the page if they are in the page layout and if the user has access to them. In Salesforce Classic, the compact layout is used only for the Salesforce mobile app. In Lightning Experience, a compact layout determines what shows at the top of the record home page. Compact layouts can be configured differently per record type. The recommended fields for compact layouts are: Title Publishing Status Validation Status (if used in your org) Record Type Language (for multilingual knowledge bases) Last Modified Date Experience Cloud has a different routing mechanism, which doesn’t go through the Knowledge dispatcher. After articles are migrated to the new Knowledge object, the Knowledge dispatcher routes to the correct record without changing the URL. Experience Cloud uses an old record ID in the record for routing. Because Experience Cloud has a different dispatcher, Lightning Knowledge provides mapping for the URL redirect. Review and set up permissions in Lightning. Create, Read, Edit, and Delete (CRUD) permissions apply to the single Knowledge object and not individual record types. Permissions per article type no longer works in Lightning Experience. To set access to Lightning Knowledge, consider each of these elements: Manage CRUD permissions with user profiles and permission sets. Manage authoring permissions per user profile or permission sets per user (for actions like edit as draft or publish, for example). Adjust permission for individual files in the Files object. (Optional) Set up which record types each user has permission to use when creating articles. (Optional) Set up validation rules to prevent certain users or user profiles from modifying articles of certain record types. Such restrictions don’t allow users to save their changes if the validation conditions aren’t met. Set up approval processes that check the record type and user and either route or reject according to your business rules. For Multiple Article Type Orgs Review each setup option for Knowledge in the Object Manager. Verify that the fields, record types, triggers, and other setup options are correct. Communication Channel Mapping—Configure communication channel mappings for the Knowledge object to set which fields are inserted into case emails per record type. Dependent Picklists—Picklist options migrate, but the mappings between them don’t. Reset dependencies after migration. Add field-level security, and define which users can access fields, as needed. Formula Fields—Redefine formulas as needed after article types are consolidated into one object. Validation Rules—Update validation rules now that article types have been consolidated into one object. Copy the settings you tested in your sandbox org. Workflow and Approval Processes—All article types are now consolidated into one object, requiring changes to validation rules. You might no longer need some workflows to be created separately for each article type because they are now all in a single object. However, you might need to adjust the workflow and approval process criteria to look at a record type. Process Builder—Make sure that processes now reference the new Knowledge object. Customizations—Inspect custom elements after the migration, and ensure that they moved to the new Knowledge object. After you’ve reviewed and accepted the migration results and completed this checklist, it’s time to train your team and roll out Lightning Knowledge to your customers.

For example, your FAQ pages are different from your tutorials, which are different from your policy statements. A record type controls an article’s content and layout. Create different record types to distinguish Knowledge articles. In Lightning Knowledge, standard record types replace custom article types. Page Layout Considerations for Lightning Knowledge A page layout determines which fields agents can view and edit when entering data for an article.

By default, all internal users with Read permission can read published articles. Assign permissions to agents and authors who publish, archive, delete, and manage articles. Use permission sets or custom profiles to give agents, authors, and other users the Knowledge access they need. For example, you can create a permission set named Article Manager that includes the permissions to create, edit, publish, and assign articles. You can then create a Knowledge Base Manager profile with permission to archive and delete articles. To see categories associated with Draft articles, standard Users must have permissions for Knowledge User and Manage Article.

So data categories, ratings, view count, and cases aren’t available fields for your list views. By default, list views in Lightning Experience show all available languages. When Lightning Knowledge is enabled, list views in the Article Management tab in Salesforce Classic show articles in the user's language by default, or the primary language for Knowledge if the user’s language isn’t available. Article Record Pages Use the Lightning App Builder to configure the default record page to match your users' workflow. Your Lightning page consists of article page layouts and the components you choose for your users. In addition to standard components, you can use components built by partners and developers from AppExchange. You can even build your own components. With Lightning pages, you can move the ratings, versions, data category, and translation components to the areas of the page that work best for your users. You can add these components to your record pages. Article Data Categories—Users with permission to manage data categories can change an article’s categories. Article Thumb Vote (Ratings)—Collect feedback with thumbs-up and thumbs-down ratings. Automatically enabled. Article Version Comparison—Compare two versions of an article to see the differences . Article Versions—Select Track Field History and Set History Tracking in the Object Manager. These options make the article version history and field changes available for Knowledge users to view in the Article Versions component. Files—Add the Files related list in your record type page layout. Translation Primary Article—Show the primary article and translation in the same page layout to assist translators. You can set visibility conditions so only translators and knowledge base managers see the side-by-side view . Translation Switcher—Give translators and administrators an easy way to switch between draft and published versions of an article in all languages.

It also determines which sections appear when users view articles. You can customize the fields, actions, and related lists for each record type and user profile with page layouts. and User Permissions Available in: Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. User Permissions Needed To customize page layouts: Customize Application You can use a page layout to customize fields, actions, and related lists for each record type and user profile. For example, when sensitive data is involved, you can customize a page layout by user profile. Then only agents assigned the user profile can see sensitive fields in the article. Consider these tips when you configure page layouts for Knowledge. Authoring actions that you add to the Salesforce Mobile and Lightning Experience Actions section of the page layout appear in the highlights panel on record pages in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app. To use inline edit with Knowledge, add the Publication Status field to your standard page layout. The Publication Status field must be in the standard page layout, not in a compact layout. However, the field can appear in both the standard and compact layouts. Tip If the Publication Status field is in a collapsed layout section, you must expand the section to load the edit icons before you can use inline editing. To increase the accessibility of inline editing, add the Publication Status field to a layout section that is likely to always be open. The Title and URL Name standard fields are required. You can’t remove them from the layout. To control which audiences can view an article, add these fields to the page layout: Visible in Internal App; Visible to Customer; Visible to Partner; and Visible in Public Knowledge base. The fields appear as checkboxes in the record.

Plan Your Knowledge Base in Salesforce Classic It's important that you consider your individual company’s needs while you develop a strategy for capturing and publishing your support team’s expertise. With a robust knowledge base, customers receive service faster or even solve their own issues. Knowledge Article Types Article types, such as FAQs and Tutorials, provide the format and structure to control how an article displays for each audience, known as a channel. For each article type you can create custom fields, customize the layout by adding or removing sections and fields, and choose a template for each channel. You can also create workflow rules and approval processes to help your organization track and manage article creation and publication. Classic Knowledge User Access Specify which agents in your company are Classic Knowledge users and give them access to article actions. Create user profiles with the user permissions they need, and then assign them to these profiles. Set Up the Knowledge One Widget Knowledge One is available as a widget that you can plug in to the Salesforce Console for Service or Salesforce Console for Sales. If you are using the Knowledge tab, you get the same easy-to-use interface for articles and external sources on cases and within the Salesforce Console for Service. You can search, send, and create articles, all without leaving the case. Articles or Knowledge Tab Find out which Salesforce Knowledge tab you are using and what you can do on each. Example Apex for Submitting Articles from Cases If your organization allows customer-support agents to create Salesforce Knowledge articles while closing a case, you can use Apex to pre-populate fields on draft articles. To do so, create an Apex class and assign it to the case article type using the example below as a guide. Use Videos from Any Provider with a Custom Visualforce Page Using a custom Visualforce page and the HTML editor, you can insert videos from any provider into your Salesforce Knowledge articles.

Give Customers Access to Your Knowledge Base Through Help Center Do you need guidelines, resources, and current discussions on the evolving world of knowledge base orientated service? Salesforce Knowledge is ""KCS Verified"" by the Consortium for Service Innovation, which recognizes best practices in customer support methodologies. By implementing Knowledge-Centered Support (KCS) features, you can create more efficient collaboration within your team and provide pertinent and accurate information to your customers. Consider the following tips when planning and using Salesforce Knowledge: Create synonym groups in Salesforce Knowledge. Synonyms are words or phrases that are treated as equivalent in article searches, letting you optimize search results. Before setting up data categories, carefully plan your category groups and their hierarchies. Also, consider how your category hierarchy maps to your role hierarchy. For more information, see Data Category Visibility . Create custom reports on your Salesforce Knowledge data. You can also install the Knowledge Base Dashboards and Reports app from the AppExchange to receive over two dozen helpful reports. Multiple agents can edit the same article at the same time. If that occurs, your changes can be overwritten by a colleague without warning, even if you save your work frequently. To avoid accidental data loss, instruct all users who edit articles to edit only the articles they're assigned. Review your usage regularly to avoid storage shortages: from Setup, enter Storage Usage in the Quick Find box, then select Storage Usage . Public knowledge base users cannot rate articles. The File custom field type allows agents to attach documents to articles. You will lose your data if you convert a custom field on an article type into any other field type. Do not convert custom fields unless no data exists for the field. When renaming Salesforce Knowledge labels note that standard field names, like title and type, are fixed. These fields do not change the labels on the article create and edit pages. If the organization is set to another language, these fields remain in the fixed label for that language. The Salesforce Knowledge search engine supports lemmatization, which is the process of reducing a word to its root form. With lemmatization, a search can match expanded forms of a search term. For example, a search for running matches items that contain run, running, and ran . Make sure that you have a clear understanding of the type of articles your organization needs, and how agents interact with these article types. This determines the article type permissions and article actions that you need to assign to Salesforce Knowledge users, which you can then use to create the set of profiles or permission sets required by your organization. For more information, see Classic Knowledge User Access . Determine if you need to create workflow rules for some of your article types. For example, you can create a rule that sends an email to an article manager when an agent creates an article upon closing a case. Determine if you need to create approval processes for some of your article types. For example, if you have a type of article that must have legal and management approval before it can be published externally, create an approval process for the article type. Knowledge Base Allocations by Edition The following table lists the total minimum number of languages, articles, and versions per article permitted for each Salesforce edition by default. Each Salesforce edition also has a default maximum number of languages, articles, and versions per article, as well. You can view the default maximum limits here . For orgs created before the Spring '18 release, the default limit for all editions is 16 languages. To request an extension for these allocations, contact Salesforce support. Note If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Edition Article, Version, and Language Allocations Essentials 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Professional 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Enterprise 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Developer 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Unlimited 150,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 10 languages If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Limits on versions retained per article don’t include versions linked to objects such as cases, work items, and undeletable lookup fields. So, for example, an article might have 25 versions, even if the default limit is 10 versions per article, if 15 of those versions are linked to cases. However, versions attached to objects such as cases count towards the total number of versions per org.

Create Article Types An article type controls how an article displays and what type of information of fields are included. Article Type Page Layouts Article-type layouts determine which fields agents can view and edit when entering data for an article. They also determine which sections appear when users view articles. The article-type template defines the format of the article, for example whether layout sections display as subtabs or as a single page with links. You can apply a layout per profile per article type. Therefore, you can display more sensitive fields of the same article to only those agents with the correct profile. Add Custom Fields to Article Types Create custom fields to store information that’s important to your articles. The only standard fields provided on article types are: Article Number, Summary, Title, and URL Name. At minimum, you want to create a field where authors can write the body of the article. Article Type Templates Article types in Salesforce Knowledge require a template for each channel. The standard article-type templates—Tab and Table of Contents—specify how the sections in the article-type layout appear in the published article. For example, if you choose the Tab template, the sections defined in the layout appear as tabs when users view an article. With the Table of Contents template, sections appear on a single page with hyperlinks to each section. You can also create a custom template using Visualforce. Custom templates aren’t associated with the article-type layout. Delete an Article Type Deleting article types can result in errors and lost data.

If you create a tab for this object, this name is used for the tab. Gender If it is appropriate for your organization’s default language, specify the gender of the label. This field appears if the organization-wide default language expects gender. Your personal language preference setting does not affect whether the field appears. For example, if the organization’s default language is English and your personal language is French, you are not prompted for gender when creating an article type. Starts with a vowel sound If it is appropriate for your organization’s default language, check if your label is preceded by ""an"" instead of ""a"". Object Name (Read only) A unique name used to refer to the article type when using the Lightning Platform API. In managed packages, this unique name prevents naming conflicts on package installations. The Object Name field can contain only underscores and alphanumeric characters. It must be unique, begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores. Description An optional description of the article type. A meaningful description helps you remember the differences between your article types when you are viewing them in a list. Track Field History Select this option to track the full history of an article and its versions.

For example, if you publish the same article in the internal app and on an Experience Cloud site, you can use field-level security to hide a custom field such as Internal Comments from Experience Cloud site users. From Setup, enter Knowledge Article Types in the Quick Find box, then select Knowledge Article Types . Click the article type. Scroll down to the Page Layouts related list or click the Page Layouts link at the top of the page. To create a page layout, click New and follow the prompts. To edit an existing layout, click Edit and make your changes. Make your changes. The layout editor consists of two parts: a palette on the upper portion of the screen and the layout on the lower portion of the screen. The palette contains the available fields and a section element. The layout contains an Information section and space for you to add sections. By default, all custom fields are included in the Information section. Important If you navigate away from your article-type layout before clicking save, your changes are lost. Note The Article Number, Summary, Title , and URL Name standard fields do not display in the layout. Article Number and Summary appear in a read-only Properties section at the top of the published article. Also included in this header are the First Published, Last Modified , and Last Published fields. Task Description Add a section Drag and drop the section element into the palette. Change the name of a section Click its title. You cannot rename the Information section. Remove a field from a section Drag it to the right side of the palette or click the remove icon next to the field. Remove a section from the article-type layout Click the remove icon next to the section name. Save your changes and continue editing the article type layout Click Quick Save . Tip Use the undo and redo buttons to step backwards and forwards, respectively. Use the following keyboard shortcuts: Undo = CTRL+Z Redo = CTRL+Y Quick Save = CTRL+S To select multiple elements individually, use CTRL+click. To select multiple elements as a group, use SHIFT+click. To quickly locate any item in the palette, use the Quick Find box. The Quick Find box is especially useful for article-type layouts that have large numbers of items available in the palette. To assign various layouts to the article type based on a user profile, click Page Layout Assignments . Click Edit Assignment . Select the profile, or profiles (using SHIFT), you want to change and select the layout from the Page Layout To Use dropdown. When creating multiple article type page layouts, consider the following limitations and functionality changes. When creating page layouts, some fields are hidden based on the agent’s license. Out of Date, Translation Completed Date, and Translation Exported Date are hidden from users who do not have a Knowledge User license or who are customer portal or partner portal users. In addition, Archived By and Is Latest Version are hidden from customer portal and partner portal users. Before Spring ‘16, preview pages showed the Summary field in the API that contained text values, even if they were not in the page layout. To continue displaying summary fields on preview pages, manually update your page layouts to include them. If you want to attach articles as PDFs to emails when solving cases, add File Attachments to the Selected Email Tools in the Feed View for the article type layout. The article edit page only shows the standard fields (Article Number, Title, URL Name, and Summary) and all the custom fields added to the layout, including the side bar fields. Other standard fields added on the page layout are ignored because they are not editable, and the custom fields are displayed in the order specified in the page layout. If an article type page layout doesn’t include a field with a validation rule , you can’t create or edit an article of that article type. Make sure all page layouts assigned to the article type by profile include all fields with validation rules. The Communication channel layout doesn’t use the page layout to determine which Article fields are inserted into a case email. The fields that are inserted include the fields selected in the Communication Channel mapping. You can set up a specific profile to generate a PDF file. When sending articles as PDFs, the pdf is generated based on the sender’s profile. Therefore, the receiver might get fields they are not meant to see. Use the Use a profile to create customer-ready article PDFs on cases setting on the Knowledge settings page so the fields in PDFs come from the page layout assigned to the configured profile. Also, Field Level Security of both the sender profile and the configured profile are applied. See Also Create Article Types Knowledge Article Types Salesforce Knowledge Help and Resources Loading "

The only requirement for custom article-type templates is that the standard controller is equal to the API Name of the article type. For example, if the API Name of the article type is Offer__kav , your markup is: <apex:page standardController=""Offer__kav""> ... page content here ... </apex:page> Note Click Component Reference for a list of the Visualforce components, such as knowledge:articleRendererToolbar and knowledge:articleCaseToolbar , available for use in custom article-type templates. If your article type has a File field , you can allow users to download the field's content. In this example, the article type is Offer , the name of the File field is my_file , and the text that appears as a link is Click me: <apex:outputLink value=""{!URLFOR($Action.Offer__kav.FileFieldDownload, Offer__kav.id, ['field'=$ObjectType.Offer__kav.fields.my_file__Body__s.name])}"">Click me</apex:outputLink> Note If the File field is empty (meaning the author didn't upload a file), the link still appears on the published article but has no function. If you do not want the link to appear when the File field is empty, replace Click me in the example with the name of the file. For example, {!Offer__kav.my_file__Name__s} . Click Save . Your custom template can now be assigned to any channel on the article type. From Setup, enter Knowledge Article Types in the Quick Find box, then select Knowledge Article Types Click an article type name. For each channel, specify the template. For Internal App, Customer and Partner, Tab is the default template. For Public Knowledge Base, Table of Contents is the default template. If you created a custom template for this article type, it also appears in the dropdown menu. Save your work. Example If you choose the Tab template, the sections you defined in the layout appear as tabs when users view an article. Published Article Using the Tab Article-Type Template If you choose the Table of Contents template, the sections you defined in the layout appear on one page with hyperlinks to each section title.

To save yourself time and enjoy the full power of the Salesforce platform, we recommend getting started with Lightning Knowledge . Going forward, new features are available exclusively in Lightning Knowledge. By default all internal users can read articles. However some licenses like the Knowledge Only User licenses, require the “AllowViewKnowledge” permission on the user’s profile. To give a user the “AllowViewKnowledge” permission on their profile, activate the permission on a cloned profile and assign the cloned profile to the user. Note To do more than read articles, agents need the Knowledge User license. From Setup, enter Users in the Quick Find box, then select Users . Click Edit next to the user's name or click New to create a user. If you are creating a user, complete all the required fields. Select the Knowledge User checkbox. Click Save . See User permissions control access to different tasks in Classic Knowledge. We recommend using permission sets or custom profiles to grant users the permissions they need. For example, you can create a permission set called “Article Manager” that includes the permissions to create, edit, publish, and assign articles. Refer to this table for details on permissions associated with Classic Knowledge tasks. Refer to Lightning Knowledge User Access on permissions associated with Lightning Knowledge.

To enable agents to perform their specific tasks, create public groups for each role and assign only the necessary article actions to those groups. Example Your Salesforce Knowledge agents are a mixture of different levels of job experience and expertise in the products and services your company offers. These examples outline four basic types of users and some of the permissions they need to perform their jobs. Scott: The Reader Scott Jackson is relatively new to the company, so he’s a basic agent of the knowledge base. Currently, he has read-only access to articles, so he can search and view articles. Readers don’t author or publish, so he won’t belong to a public group or need to submit articles for approval. He needs the following permissions to perform his job. Scott Permission Article Type-Specific Permissions Salesforce Knowledge Functionality Manage Articles Read Create Edit Delete Search articles from and attach articles to cases Search for and read articles from the Articles tab Amber: The Candidate Amber Delaney is a candidate-level agent and can create and publish articles with statuses of either Work in Progress or Not Validated . If Amber works on an article with a different validation status, she must send it to a queue for approval before it’s published. Amber is part of the KCS Candidate public group and submits the articles she can’t publish to the Publishing External queue. She needs the following permissions to perform her job duties. Amber Permission Article Type-Specific Permissions Salesforce Knowledge Functionality Manage Articles Read Create Edit Delete Search articles from and attach articles to cases Search for and read articles from the Articles tab Create or edit article from the Article Management tab Edit draft articles from the Article Management tab Edit published or archived articles Anne: The Contributor As a contributor, Anne Murphy is a more advanced Knowledge user. She understands the standards for articles in the organization and can create articles and publish articles with Validated Internal status. She can also work on articles authored by other users if they have either Work in Progress or Not Validated statuses, and can change them to Validated Internal . Since she doesn’t have permission to publish articles to an external audience, she must submit those customer-facing articles to the Publishing External queue. Note In Salesforce Classic, if you don't have the ""Manage Articles"" permission, you don't see draft articles. However, you can still approve draft articles by going to the Knowledge approval page. Anne is a member of the Contributor public group and she needs the following permissions to perform her job duties. Permission Article Type-Specific Permissions Salesforce Knowledge Functionality Manage Articles Read Create Edit Delete Create articles from cases using the simple editor Create articles from cases using the standard editor Search articles from and attach articles to cases Create articles from answers Search for and read articles from the Articles tab Delete articles (version or entire) from Article Management tab Assign articles from Article Management tab Archive articles from the Article Management tab Pat: The Publisher Pat Brown is Knowledge domain expert and is responsible for reviewing and publishing articles to an external audience. He is a member of the Publisher public group. Pat also belongs to the Publishing External queue. He needs the following permissions to perform his job duties. Permission Article Type-Specific Permissions Salesforce Knowledge Functionality Manage Articles Read Create Edit Delete Create articles from cases using the simple editor Create articles from cases using the standard editor Search articles from and attach articles to cases Create articles from answers Search for and read articles from the Articles tab Create or edit article from the Article Management tab Edit draft articles from the Article Management tab Delete articles (version or entire) from Article Management tab Publish article from Article Management tab Assign articles from Article Management tab Edit published or archived articles Archive articles from the Article Management tab How they all work together Each user profile defines an agent's permission to perform different job duties and functions. To enable agents to perform these functions, you create public groups for each role and assign only the necessary article actions to that group. The criteria you create in the approval process defines which validation status can be automatically approved and published and which article must be approved and published by a domain expert. For example, Anne, the Contributor, can create a Validated External article, but based on the article actions assigned to her public group, the approval process sends her article to Pat, the Publisher, to be published. Pat, as a Publisher, can publish his own articles without submitting them to a queue. The following table lists the job functions that each role needs to perform on articles in the organization Job Function Reader Candidate Contributor Publisher Create and publish Work in Progress No Automatically approved and published Automatically approved and published Yes Create and publish Not Validated No Automatically approved and published Automatically approved and published Yes Create and publish Validated Internal No Needs approval Automatically approved and published Yes Create and publish Validated External No Needs approval Needs approval Yes Update and publish Work in Progress No No Automatically approved and published Yes Update and publish Not Validated No No Automatically approved and published Yes Update and publish Validated Internal No No Automatically approved and published Yes Update and publish Validated External No No Needs approval Yes Create Public Groups for Knowledge Salesforce Knowledge uses public groups as a way to assign users to specific tasks related to articles. When you assign article actions to a public group, you can grant users in that group the ability to do things like publish articles with a specified validation status. Public groups are also used in approval processes to manage the publishing workflow. Assign Article Actions to Public Groups Article actions let agents participate in the article publishing process. By default, all article actions are assigned to users with the “Manage Articles” user permission. Agents can complete an action as long as they have the correct article type permission. You can control article action access by assigning public groups to article actions and adding agents the relevant public groups. To further restrict actions like publishing, you can create approval processes that allow agents to publish only those articles that have specific validation statuses. For example, many contributors can write many articles but you can create an approval process so no articles are published until they are reviewed and validated by a qualified author.

If Grant Access Using Hierarchies is deselected, users that are higher in the role hierarchy don't receive automatic access. However, some users can still access records they don't own. Examples of such users include users with the View All and Modify All object permissions and the View All Data and Modify All Data system permissions. Search From the Search dropdown, select the type of member to add. If you don't see the member you want to add, enter keywords in the search box and click Find . For account owners to see child records owned by high-volume Experience Cloud site users, they must be members of any share groups with access to the site users' data.

Selected Delegated Groups In this list, specify any delegated administration groups whose members can add or remove members from this public group. Select groups from the Available Delegated Groups box, and then click Add . This list appears only in public groups. Click Save . Note When you edit groups, sharing rules are automatically reevaluated to add or remove access as needed. If these changes affect too many records at once, a message appears warning that the sharing rules aren’t automatically reevaluated, and you must manually recalculate them. Now assign only the necessary actions to your groups so the selected members can perform their tasks while keeping the integrity of your knowledge base.

User Permissions Needed To edit Salesforce Knowledge settings: Customize Application To create an Apex class: Author Apex For more information on the syntax and use of Apex, see the Lightning Platform Apex Code Developer's Guide . Set up the example by creating the following article type, field, and data categories. Do not change the default API Name assigned to each new object. Create an article type called FAQ . Create a text custom field called Details . Create a category group called Geography and assign it a category called USA . Create a category group called Topics and assign it a category called Maintenance . Now, create and assign the Apex class. From Setup, enter Apex Classes in the Quick Find box, then select Apex Classes and click New . To specify the version of Apex and the API used with this class, click Version Settings . If your organization has installed managed packages from the AppExchange, you can also specify which version of each managed package to use with this class. Use the default values for all versions. This associates the class with the most recent version of Apex and the API, as well as each managed package. You can specify an older version of a managed package if you want to access components or functionality that differs from the most recent package version. You can specify an older version of Apex and the API to maintain specific behavior.

Case c = [select subject, description from Case where id=:sourceId]; article.put('title', 'From Case: '+c.subject); //this overrides the default behavior of pre-filling the title of the article with the subject of the closed case. article.put('Details__c',c.description); ctl.selectDataCategory('Geography','USA'); //Only one category per category group can be specified. ctl.selectDataCategory('Topics','Maintenance'); } From Setup, enter Knowledge Settings in the Quick Find box, then select Knowledge Settings and click Edit . Verify the case settings ; using our example, the Default article type should be FAQ. From the Use Apex Customization menu, select AgentContributionArticleController and click Save . As a result of this example, when agents create an article from the case-close screen: The data from the Description field on the case appears in the Details field of the article. The title of the article contains From Case: and the case subject. The article is automatically assigned to the USA data category and the Maintenance data category.

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Knowledge Settings From the Knowledge Settings page, you can create a knowledge base experience for your support agents, partners, and customers. Knowledge Scalability Every Salesforce Knowledge article can have several versions: one draft, one published, and several archived versions, and each of these versions can have multiple translations. Thus, the total number of article versions in an org can be much higher than the number of articles . When scaling your org, pay attention to both the total number of article versions and edition-specific limits on articles. Control Data Integrity with Validation Rules Ensure that your article content is compliant with your company standards. Create validation rules for each article type to check whether required fields have the appropriate values based on the article’s status. Define Validation Status Picklist Values When the Validation Status field is enabled on the Knowledge Settings page, you can create picklist values that show the state of the article. For example, values could be Validated, Not Validated , or Needs Review . Modify Default Category Group Assignments for Articles Salesforce Knowledge uses data categories to classify articles. Data categories are organized in category group. After creating category groups, admins decide which groups to use for Salesforce Knowledge articles. For example, if your org uses both the Answers and Salesforce Knowledge, you might want one category group to be used by the answers site and two other category groups for articles. Answers and articles can use the same category group. Authors can assign up to eight data categories from one category group to an article so that users searching for articles can find and filter by category. By default, all the category groups you create are assigned to Salesforce Knowledge Filter Articles with Data Category Mapping Make suggested articles more relevant when solving cases. Map case fields to data categories to filter for articles assigned to those data categories. For example, cases with a field for which product they are about can be mapped to the data category of that product. Articles assigned that category or product, are filtered to the top of the suggested article list. Workflow and Approvals for Articles Creating processes where Knowledge experts review, validate, and approve articles for publication is critical to creating a trustworthy knowledge base. Implementing approval processes with Salesforce Knowledge gives you more control over the content and publication of your articles. Custom Fields for Articles The first step in creating a custom field for articles is choosing the field type. Field-Level Security on Articles Field-level security lets administrators restrict readers' access to specific fields on detail and edit pages. For example, you can make a “Comment” field in an article visible for Internal App profiles but not for public Experience Cloud profiles. Article History Tracking (Lightning Experience) Track the history of certain fields in articles. If you have history tracking enabled, open an article and click Version to see a version history list. You can also set tracking for the article type and track the full history of an article and its versions. Article events are tracked for up to 18 months. Article History Tracking (Salesforce Classic) You can track the history of certain fields in articles. If you have history tracking enabled, open an article of that type and click Version to see a version history list. You can also set tracking for the article type and track the full history of an article and its versions. Article events are tracked for up to 18 months. Set Up Knowledge Component Actions Solve issues quickly with the articles in your knowledge base, and choose how customers see the article. Use Knowledge component actions to share article contents or links from your Salesforce and Experience Cloud sites.

Knowledge One Switch from the Articles tab to the Knowledge tab To switch users from the Articles tab to the Knowledge tab, add the Knowledge One permission to their profiles. Suggest related articles on cases In the Knowledge tab, Search suggests articles based on content similarity and links to similar cases. If no article links to a similar case, you'll receive suggested articles with similar titles or common keywords in admin-selected case fields. Suggested articles are available in the Salesforce Console for Service and your portals when you view existing or new cases. If the suggested articles aren't relevant, the user working the case can search with specific keywords, which can result in different article results. The list of suggested Knowledge Articles are stored in a cache that updates periodically. If you're not receiving relevant Knowledge Articles, try again later. By default, the Subject field is selected. Choose up to five of the available short text fields that include a description of the issue, the affected product, or the case topic. We recommend choosing short text fields to return more relevant results. Only the first 255 characters of the content from all admin-selected fields are searched. Highlight relevant article text within search results In the Knowledge tab, Search generates a snippet of the relevant article text with the search terms bolded. Auto-complete keyword search In the Knowledge tab, Search suggests the three most popular keyword searches performed on the Knowledge tab. Suggestions are based on the channel (internal, customer, partner, or public) the reader is searching. Keyword search history is refreshed one time a day. Auto-complete title search Search on the Knowledge tab suggests up to three articles with matching titles.

We recommend that your Default Knowledge Base Language and your organization's language are the same. Single or Multiple Language If you support more than one language, select Multiple Languages and choose the translation settings. If you enable multiple languages, you can’t revert to a single language knowledge base. Case Settings Allow agents to create an article from a case This setting applies to Knowledge only in Salesforce Classic.

Make sure that users have Manage Articles, Read, and Create permissions. Designate the following: The default article type from the dropdown list. For articles created when closing a case, assign the article to a user. Help agents create articles fast by selecting an Apex class that pre-populates fields on the draft. By default, the Title field in all draft articles contains the case subject. If you enable this option, click Layout Properties on each case-close page layout, and select Enable submissions during case close and Submit Articles . Use a profile to create article PDFs By default, when a user creates an article PDF directly from a case, the PDF includes all the article fields visible to that user. If you want PDFs generated according to a different profile, for example, a profile that hides certain fields from customers, select Use a profile to create customer-ready article PDFs on cases , and choose the profile that determines field visibility. This setting applies to Knowledge only in Salesforce Classic. Enable list of cases linked to an article Agents and Salesforce Knowledge managers can see a list of cases an article is attached to. This view helps validate that the article is the right solution for a case and shows which articles are used most, without running a report. The Linked Cases related list Is visible on the detail or preview page of any article that has been published at least one time. shows a maximum of 200 cases. is sorted in descending order by the date the article was linked to the case. The sort order can’t be changed. doesn’t appear on archived articles or a translation’s edit and detail pages. doesn’t appear for external users such as portal or Experience Cloud users or on the Salesforce app. Share Article via URL Settings Allow agents to share articles via public URLs You can share an article that is available on a public knowledge base with a URL. In the Available Sites list, select the sites you want to allow your agents to send URLs from and add them to the Selected Sites list. Agents can then email customer service clients with a URL to link directly to the article in your public knowledge base. Answers Settings Allow agents to create an article from a reply When this option is selected, members of an answers site or Chatter Answers site can convert helpful replies into articles. The article type you select determines which fields appear on the draft article. However, on all articles the Title contains the question and the Summary contains the reply. After a reply is promoted to an article, the original reply has a status message indicating its association with the draft article. When the article is published, the message on the reply includes a link to the article.

Thus, the total number of article versions in an org can be much higher than the number of articles . When scaling your org, pay attention to both the total number of article versions and edition-specific limits on articles. Available in: All Editions Each Salesforce edition has its own limits on Knowledge articles, versions, and language translations. Also, all editions share a maximum limit of total article versions allowed. Keep all of these limits in mind when scaling your org. The total number of Knowledge articles in an org is calculated as follows. Total # of versions = (# of articles) x (# of retained 1 versions per article) x (# of translations per version) For example, if you have 100,000 articles, each with a total of 5 versions (1 draft, 1 published, 3 archived), and 5 translations of each of those versions, you have 2,500,000 total article versions. So in calculating your capacity needs, and determining which edition you need, think versions . Do you have a multilingual customer base with lots of translations? Do you have a rigorous editing process with many drafts? Do you keep archived versions of articles around for a long time? Knowledge Base Allocations by Edition The following table lists the total minimum number of languages, articles, and versions per article permitted for each Salesforce edition by default. Each Salesforce edition also has a default maximum number of languages, articles, and versions per article, as well. You can view the default maximum limits here . For orgs created before the Spring '18 release, the default limit for all editions is 16 languages. To request an extension for these allocations, contact Salesforce support. Note If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Edition Article, Version, and Language Allocations Essentials 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Professional 500 articles, 10 versions per article, 1 language Enterprise 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Developer 50,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 5 languages Unlimited 150,000 articles, 10 versions per article, 10 languages If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the article limits. Limits on versions retained per article don’t include versions linked to objects such as cases, work items, and undeletable lookup fields. So, for example, an article might have 25 versions, even if the default limit is 10 versions per article, if 15 of those versions are linked to cases. However, versions attached to objects such as cases count towards the total number of versions per org. Monitoring Article and Version Counts To see how many versions and articles you have: Go to Settings. In the Search box, type Storage Usage . Select Storage Usage . The total number of versions in the org is listed under “Knowledge Versions.” The number of articles in the org is listed under “Knowledge.” See Also Plan Your Knowledge Base in Lightning Experience Plan Your Knowledge Base in Salesforce Classic 1 “Retained” articles can include not just versions you’ve created, but versions attached to other objects, such as cases or work items.

Optionally, add a time-dependent workflow action by clicking Add Time Trigger . Provide time trigger information, and then click Save . Click Done . From Setup, enter Approval Processes in the Quick Find box, then select Approval Processes . Choose the Approval Process Wizard. Two wizards are available to help you through the approval setup process. Choose the one that meets your requirement the best. Provide a name, unique name, and description for the process. Specify criteria for entering the process. For example, you can specify that an article published on a public site requires approval: Visible on public site equals True . Specify approvers for the process. Let the submitter choose the approver manually. (default) Prompts the user to select the next approver. Automatically assign an approver using a standard or custom hierarchy field. Assigns the approval request to the user in the field displayed next to this option. You select this field when you configure the approval process. Automatically assign to a queue. Available only for objects that support queues. Assigns approval requests to a queue. Automatically assign to approver(s). Assigns the approval request to one or more specific users, specific queues, or users related to the submitted record. You can add up to 25 per step. Select the email template that the process uses to notify approvers. When an approval process assigns an approval request to a user, Salesforce automatically sends the user an approval request email. The email contains a link to the approval page in Salesforce, where the agent can approve or reject the request and add comments. Configure the approval request page layout. The approver approves or rejects the article from this page. You can add as many fields to this page as you think your agents require to reasonably assess an article's content. For example, you could choose to include a summary of the article's content, the product discussed, and the author's name. Specify which users are allowed to submit articles for approval. For example, for articles that require editing before approval, you could create a public group containing editors, and then specify that only members of that group can submit articles for approval. Activate the approval process. Keep the following in mind when creating approval processes for article types. You need to be a Knowledge user in order to publish an article as part of the approval process. Adding an approval process to an article type lets your organization ensure that the required reviewers approve the article before it's published, as long as it’s not already scheduled. Articles scheduled for publication before being sent for approval are published regardless of the approval status. When an approval process is enabled for an article's article type, the Approval History related list displays on the article details page. When creating an approval process, change the final approval action to “Unlock the record for editing” to allow agents to publish the article. Articles aren't published automatically at the end of an approval process. Agents must click Publish... to make the article available in the publishing channels. When an approval process is associated with an article type, agents with the “Manage Articles” permission could see both the Publish... and the Submit for Approval buttons on an article's detail page. (Permissions and article actions determine which buttons they see.) These agents can publish an article without submitting it for approval. To prevent this scenario from affecting many users, assign the “Publish Articles” article action to a limited group of users instead of giving it to all users with the “Manage Articles” permission. Ensure that the users with direct publishing capability know which articles need approval before publication. In Salesforce Classic, if you don't have the ""Manage Articles"" permission, you don't see draft articles. However, you can still approve draft articles by going to the Knowledge approval page. Workflow rules and approval processes apply to the “Draft to Publication” portion of the article publishing cycle. Workflow rules aren’t available for archiving. Approval processes aren’t available for translation or archiving. Note When an article is published from the edit page, the article is first saved and then published. Workflow rules apply to the saved draft article but not the published article. A user who only has read access to an article type can publish a draft article of that type if there is an approval process associated to the article type and the approval process is complete but the article has not been published. Create Workflow Actions for Knowledge Knowledge actions are templates that link a workflow action to an article type. When knowledge actions are enabled, you can use them to link article types to specific workflow article actions, such as publishing. For example, if you want each FAQ to publish as a new version when it completes the approval process, you can create a knowledge action that links an FAQ article to the Publish as New action. Then, when you create an approval process for FAQs, select the new Knowledge action. See Also Salesforce Knowledge Help and Resources "

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ) and Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and the Unlimited Edition with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Field Type Description Article Currency In a multiple currency org, an article can have an article currency field to set the article's currency ISO code. Currency Lets agents enter a currency amount. The system formats the field as a currency amount, which can be useful if you export data to a spreadsheet application. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Salesforce uses the round-half-to-even tie-breaking rule for currency fields. For example, 23.5 becomes 24, 22.5 becomes 22, −22.5 becomes −22, and −23.5 becomes −24. Values lose precision after 15 decimal places. Date Lets agents enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar. In reports, you can limit the data by specific dates using any custom date field. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Date/Time Lets agents enter a date or pick a date from a popup calendar, and enter a time of day. They can also add the current date and time by clicking the date and time link next to the field. The time of day includes AM or PM notation. In reports, you can limit the data by specific dates and times using any custom date field. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Email Lets agents enter an email address, which is validated to ensure a proper format. Character limit is 80. If this field is specified for contacts or leads, agents can choose the address when clicking Send an Email . You can't use custom email addresses for mass emails. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. File Lets agents upload and attach a file to an article. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Note the following caveats about File fields: The maximum attachment size is 25 MB. You can add up to 5 File fields to each article type; contact Salesforce to increase these limits. If the Disallow HTML documents and attachments security setting is enabled, File fields do not support HTML files. Text content in a File field attachment is searchable. You can search up to 25 MB of attached files on an article. For example, if an article has six 5-MB file attachments, the first 4.16 MB of each file is searchable. You cannot attach Salesforce CRM Content files using the File field. The File field type is not supported in Developer edition. The filename cannot exceed 40 characters. You cannot convert a File field type into any other data type. File Fields are available in Salesforce Classic only. Formula Lets agents automatically calculate values based on other values or fields such as merge fields. Salesforce uses the round half up tie-breaking rule for numbers in formula fields. For example, 12.345 becomes 12.35 and −12.345 becomes −12.35. In Database.com, the Formula editor does not provide a Check Syntax button. Syntax checking occurs when the agent attempts to save the formula. Lookup Relationship Creates a relationship between two records so you can associate them with each other. For example, opportunities have a lookup relationship with cases that lets you associate a particular case with an opportunity. A lookup relationship creates a field that Lets agents click a lookup icon and select another record from a window. On the associated record, you can then display a related list to show all the records that are linked to it. You can create lookup relationship fields that link to users, standard objects, or custom objects. If a lookup field references a record that has been deleted, Salesforce clears the value of the lookup field by default. Alternatively, you can choose to prevent records from being deleted if they're in a lookup relationship. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Lookup relationship fields are not available in Personal Edition. Lookup relationship fields to campaign members are not available; however, lookup relationship fields from campaign members to other objects are available. Number Lets agents enter any number. This entry is treated as a real number and any leading zeros are removed. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Salesforce uses the round half up tie-breaking rule for number fields. For example, 12.345 becomes 12.35 and −12.345 becomes −12.34. Salesforce rounds numbers referenced in merge fields according to the user's locale, not the number of decimal spaces specified in the number field configuration. Percent Lets agents enter a percentage number, for example, '10'. The system automatically adds the percent sign to the number. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. If the decimal value is greater than 15, and you add a percent sign to the number, a runtime error occurs. Values lose precision after 15 decimal places. Phone Lets agents enter any phone number. Character limit is 40. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Salesforce automatically formats it as a phone number. Picklist Lets agents select a value from a list you define. Picklist (Dependent) Lets agents select a value from a list dependent on the value of another field. Picklist (Multi-select) Lets agents select more than one picklist value from a list you define. These fields display each value separated by a semicolon. Text Lets agents enter any combination of letters, numbers, or symbols. You can set a maximum length, up to 255 characters. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Text Area Lets agents enter up to 255 characters that display on separate lines similar to a Description field. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article. Text Area (Long) Lets agents enter up to 131,072 characters that display on separate lines similar to a Description field. You can set the length of this field type to a lower limit, if desired. Any length from 256 to 131,072 characters is allowed. The default is 32,768 characters. Every time an agent presses Enter in a long text area field, a line break and return character are added, and both count toward the character limit. Also, smart links add more characters than what is displayed. If you lower the character limit and you have articles that surpass the new limit, the articles can’t be edited until the limit is reset higher than their character counts. Text Area (Rich) Lets agents enter up to 131,072 characters of HTML-supported text, including code samples () and smart links between Salesforce Knowledge articles. You can have up to 100 links to different Salesforce Knowledge articles in one rich text field. When you convert a text area (rich) field to a text area (long) field, links are displayed as link reference numbers, not URLs. The upgraded editor doesn’t support Internet Explorer version 7 or version 8 in compatibility mode. If you are using these browsers, use the older editor. URL Lets agents enter up to 255 characters of any valid website address. When agents click the field, the URL opens in a separate browser window. Only the first 50 characters are displayed on the record detail pages. You can make this field required to ensure that an agent enters a value before saving an article.

Some user permissions override both page layouts and field-level security settings. For example, users with the “Edit Read Only Fields” permission can always edit read-only fields regardless of any other settings. Important Field-level security doesn't prevent searching on the values in a field. When search terms match on field values protected by field-level security, the associated records are returned in the search results without the protected fields and their values.

When the article has files that exceed the 10-mb attachment limit, agents are asked to select which files to attach and retry sending the email. Note If rich text is not enabled on your case feed layout for the article type, only article text is embedded into the email and the action changes to Email article text only .

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Note If you are looking for instructions on importing translated articles that you've sent to a localization vendor, see Import Translated Articles . Consider these best practices and requirements as you prepare your articles for import. Test your import using a small set of articles. Sort your articles by information type. In Classic, import each article type individually. In Lightning Knowledge, you can import articles of multiple record types at once. Ensure that each information type has a corresponding record type or, in Salesforce Classic, an article type that matches its structure and content. Create a list of fields available in each article or record type, and verify that your article contents match the structure of each type. Verify that the article's field-level security settings allow you to edit the fields. Use rich text fields to import HTML content. Prepare the .html files with the content for each rich text area field. Ensure that the HTML is compliant with the tags and attributes supported in the rich text area field. The article importer does not support subfields. If you have fields within fields, adjust your structure and content before importing into Salesforce Knowledge. Create a .csv File for Article Import The import file maps the article contents to Knowledge article fields. For example, map a Title column in your .csv file with the standard Title field to import each article's title. Set Article Import Parameters Specify import parameters in a property file using key names and corresponding values. For example, use the key DateFormat to specify that a date custom field appears in the DateFormat=dd/MM/YYYY format. Or, specify the character encoding and field separator used for the import file. Create an Article .zip File for Import To complete your article import, create a .zip file with your parameters, .csv, and .html files, and upload them to Salesforce Knowledge.

User Permissions Needed To import articles: Manage Salesforce Knowledge AND Manage Articles AND Manage Knowledge Article Import/Export AND Read, Create, Edit, and Delete on the article type Important Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations. Create a .csv file to import articles. Note In Salesforce Classic, you import each article type separately, so you create a .csv file for each article type. In Lightning Knowledge, you can import articles of different types in one .csv file and set the record type during import. There can only be one .csv file and one .properties file. The .csv file and the .properties file must be in the root directory. The compression process must preserve the folder and subfolder structure. The .zip file name can’t contain special characters. The .zip file can't exceed 20 MB and the individual, uncompressed, files within the zip file can't exceed 10 MB. .csv files can't have more than 10,000 rows, including the header row. Therefore, you can have a maximum of 9,999 articles and translations. .csv file rows can't exceed 400,000 characters. .csv file cells can't exceed 32 KB. Each article in the .csv file can't have more than 49 translations. In the first row, specify the article's fields and metadata, such as title, language, data categories, and channels. Enter one item in each column. You can use the following fields and metadata to import content. Field or data Description isMasterLanguage Identifies the article as a primary (1) or translation (0). Required to import articles with translations, however, isMasterLanguage can’t be in a .csv file to import articles without translations. A translation must follow its primary article so that it’s associated with the primary article preceding it. Title The article or translation's title. Required for all imports. Record Type Indicates an article’s record type, for example, FAQ. Article import requires the 15-character, case-sensitive ID format. Standard and custom fields Refer to an article type's standard fields using field names and refer to custom fields using API names. If the related article type field is mandatory, leaving a row cell empty can cause your articles to be skipped. Rich text area field Use the rich text area custom fields to import .html files or images. Refer to an article type's rich text area field using its API name. File field Use the file custom fields to import any file type (.doc, .pdf, .txt). Refer to an article type's file field using its API name. Data category groups To categorize the imported articles, use category groups. Refer to a category group using its unique name prefixed with datacategorygroup. . For example, use datacategorygroup.Products to specify the category group Products. Channel To specify where the imported articles are available, use the keyword Channels . Language Specify the articles' language. Required to import articles with translations. Optional to import articles without translations. If you don't include this column, the articles automatically belong to the default knowledge base language and you can't import translations along with the primary articles. In subsequent rows, specify the articles you want to import. Use one row per article, and enter the appropriate information in each field or metadata column. You can leave a column blank to skip importing data. For example, if some fields only appear in certain record types, enter values only for the appropriate articles of those types. Important All file names are case-sensitive and must exactly match what is in the .csv file. Consideration Notes Standard or custom fields Enter the articles' data for each field, except for rich text area fields where you must enter the relative path to the corresponding .html file in your .zip file. The article importer does not support subfields. If you have fields within fields, adjust your structure and content before importing into Salesforce Knowledge. Rich text area field Always enter the .html file path relative to the location of the .csv file. Never enter raw text. If the specified path doesn't exist, the related article isn't imported. Note the following information about importing HTML and images. We recommend that you create one folder for the .html files (for example, /data) and another for images (for example, /data/images ). To import images, include the images in an .html file using the <img> tag and src attribute. Ensure that the src value is a relative path from the .html file to the image folder. Images must be .png, .gif , or .jpeg files. Each image file can't exceed 1 MB. If you have multiple rich text area fields, create a separate .html file for the contents of each field. .html file contents can't exceed the maximum size for its field. If a date doesn't match the date format specified in the property file, the related article isn't imported. If an .html file references a file that isn't allowed, the related article isn't imported. If an .html file references an image that's missing, the related article is imported without the image. File field In Lightning Knowledge, custom file fields are replaced with Salesforce Files. Enter the path relative to the file's location. If the specified path doesn't exist, the related article isn't imported. Note the following information about importing files. We recommend that you create a folder for your files (for example, /files ). Each file must not exceed 5 MB. Category groups Use unique category names to categorize articles. Use the plus symbol (+) to specify more than one category. For example, Laptop+Desktop . Note the following information about data category groups. Leaving the cell row empty causes your article to be set to No Categories. If you specify a category and its parent (for example, Europe+France) the import process skips the child category France and keeps the parent category Europe, because application of a parent category implicitly includes the category's children. When importing articles with translations and associated data categories, only the primary article retains the data categories. The article translations have no associated data category upon import. Channels Specify articles' channels using the keywords. application for Internal App. If you don't specify a channel, application is the default. sites for Public Knowledge Base. csp for Customer. prm for Partner. Use the plus (+) symbol to specify more than one channel (for example, application+sites+csp to make an article available in all channels). When importing articles with translations and associated channels, only the primary article retains the channels. The article translations have no associated channels upon import. Example The following example shows .csv files to import product offer articles. The first file imports articles without translations. The second .csv file imports articles with translations. The .csv files contain titles, summaries, and descriptions. They also classify the articles in the category group Products and make them available for specific channels. The description__c field is a rich text area and only supports paths to .html files. The summary__c field is a text field and only supports raw text. The summary field is optional, and summary__c is left blank for some rows. The RecordTypeId sets the Product Offer record type for two of the articles, and the “Best Desktop Computer Deals” article is an FAQ.

Search Highlights and Snippets in Knowledge Articles Quickly identify the best article and see how articles match your search terms with relevant text and highlighted search terms in the search results. Synonym Groups for Article Searches Create synonym groups so words or phrases are treated equally in searches. When users search Salesforce Knowledge articles, they find matches for all terms in a synonym group. Promote Articles in Search Results Associate keywords with knowledge articles to optimize search results in Salesforce Knowledge. Users who search for these keywords by pressing Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac) see the article appear first in their search results. Manage Promoted Search Terms in Knowledge Articles From a single page, you can view, edit, and delete all the promoted search terms that are associated with Salesforce Knowledge articles. Enable Topics for Articles Classify and search knowledge articles by assigning topics. Topics can be added from the article view and detail pages. Suggested topics, which are only supported in English, are terms extracted from the article, so that they are more concrete and precise than a data category assignment. When searching, topics can be used to index the article, so the matched articles are more relevant to keyword searches. Article Search Results How search works for knowledge articles depends on your use of search options, search terms, wildcards, and operators. Salesforce Knowledge search uses the same custom search algorithms that are available throughout Salesforce, which include mechanisms such as tokenization, lemmatization, and stopword lists, to return relevant search results. Use More Case Keywords to Find Articles When searching knowledge articles from a case, by default, only the case title is used in the search. Often, you want to use information from the case for more accurate search results, or create a custom search button. See Also Salesforce Knowledge Help and Resources "

When users search Salesforce Knowledge articles, they find matches for all terms in a synonym group. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ) and Lightning Experience Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and the Unlimited Edition with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. A search for one term in a synonym group returns results for all terms in the group. For example, if you define a synonym group with these synonyms: CRM, customer relationship management, Salesforce then a search for customer relationship management matches articles that contain customer relationship management and articles that contain CRM or Salesforce . To create a custom synonym group, from Setup, enter Synonyms in the Quick Find box, then select Synonyms . An org can create up to 10,000 synonym groups with up to six terms in each group. Synonyms affect search behavior in these ways. Priority If a search term is part of a synonym group, the search results list items that contain the search term, followed by items that contain other terms in the synonym group. For example, if this synonym group is defined: fruit, oranges Then a search for oranges matches a list of items containing oranges , followed by items containing fruit . Note In the Article Management tab, if you sort the list by clicking a column header, the sort order, not priority, persists in the current and additional searches. Wildcards If a wildcard is used in a search, the wildcard expands the search term, but the search doesn't match any synonyms, even if the search phrase contains a defined synonym. For example, if these synonym groups are defined: fruit, oranges, apples cabbage, lettuce Then a search for orang* lettuce matches items that contain orange and oranges , but doesn't match items that contain fruit, apples, and cabbage . Operators If a search phrase contains an operator (AND / OR / AND NOT ), synonym matches are returned only if the entire search phrase is a defined synonym. For example, if these synonym groups are defined: fruit, oranges and apples vegetables, carrots Then a search for oranges and apples returns matches for all items that contain the literal string oranges and apples and items that contain the term fruit . However, if the search phrase is fruit and vegetables , which is not a defined synonym, the search matches only those items that contain both the terms, fruit and vegetables . In this case, AND functions as an operator and synonym matches are not returned in the search results. In terms of this example, items that contain a synonym of either fruit or vegetables (items that contain the term carrots or the phrase oranges and apples) are not returned. Exact phrase matches If a defined synonym is within an exact phrase search, using quotation marks, the search doesn't treat it as a synonym. Lemmatization Synonyms aren’t lemmatized in search results; instead, they are matched as an exact phrase. However, the search term is lemmatized. For example, if this synonym group is defined: quench, drink orange juice Then a search for quench matches items that contain quench, quenched, quenching, and drink orange juice , but doesn't match items that contain drinking orange juice . Ignored words Words that are normally ignored in searches, such as the, to, and for , are matched if the word is part of a defined synonym. For example, if this synonym group is defined: peel the orange, cut the apple Then a search for peel the orange matches items that contain the exact string peel the orange . Overlapping synonyms If a search term consists of overlapping synonyms from different groups, the search matches synonyms in all the overlapping synonym groups. For example, if these synonym groups are defined: orange marmalade, citrus marmalade recipe, sugar Then a search for orange marmalade recipe matches items that contain orange marmalade, citrus, marmalade recipe, and sugar . Subsets If one synonym group includes a synonym that is a subset of a synonym in another group, a search for the subset term doesn't match items that contain synonyms from the subset synonym group. For example, if these synonym groups are defined: orange, apple orange marmalade, citrus marmalade, jam Then a search for orange marmalade matches items that contain orange marmalade and citrus , but doesn't match items that contain apple or jam .

Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. User Permissions Needed To create, edit, and delete promoted search terms: Manage Promoted Search Terms Promoted search terms are useful for highlighting an article that you know is commonly used to resolve a support issue when a user’s search contains certain keywords. An article must be published for you to manage its promoted terms. To change the promoted search terms, open the published article. In the Promoted Search Terms related list, click New or New Promoted Term . Enter the keywords that you want to associate with the article. You can associate the same term with multiple articles. If the user’s search matches the promoted term, all associated articles are promoted in search results, ordered by relevancy. The maximum number of characters per promoted term is 100. For best results matching users’ search terms, limit each promoted term to a few keywords. Click Save . Example For example, if an article addresses a common support issue such as login problems, you can associate the terms password and password change . Article search matches a promoted term whenever all keywords within the term occur within the user’s search terms, in any sequence. Each keyword must match exactly. For example: The promoted term password matches a search for change password . The promoted term password change matches a search for how do I change my password but doesn’t match forgot password . The promoted term password doesn’t match a search for change passwords . Consider these limitations and general limits when you use promoted search terms. Your organization can create a maximum of 2,000 promoted terms. For best results, use them selectively, create a limited number of promoted terms and a limited number of promoted articles per term. If your organization translates articles into multiple languages, each promoted term is associated with one article version and the article version’s language. If you need equivalent promoted terms to be associated with each translation, you must specify promoted terms for each translation. For example, associate change password with an English language article version and changer mot de passe with a French language article version. The end user’s language setting determines the scope of the article search. Search results exclude article versions and any associated promoted terms that aren’t in the user’s language. When a user performs a Knowledge search, the search engine retrieves all the articles with at least one promoted search term that matches the user's terms. Then it places those articles at the top of the search result list. When a user searches for Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai (CJKT) terms, search results can be inaccurate. Simplify the term in Promoted Search, or create an additional field on the article and add the term.

Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Many factors influence the order in which articles appear in the results list. Salesforce evaluates your search terms and your data to move more relevant matches higher in your list of results. Some of these factors include: Operators—When you don’t specify an operator in your article search, the search engine determines the best operator to use. Many searches use “AND” as the default operator. When you search for multiple terms, all the terms must match to generate a result. Matching on all terms tends to produce search results that are more relevant than searches using the “OR” operator, where matches on any of the search query terms appear in the results. If the search engine doesn’t return any results that match all the terms, it looks for matches using the “OR” operator. With the “OR” operator, the search engine boosts documents that contain more terms from the search query, so that they appear higher in the results list. Frequency—This algorithm calculates the frequency with which a term appears within each article. The algorithm then weighs them against each other to produce the initial set of search results. Relevancy—Articles that are frequently viewed or that are frequently attached to cases appear higher in the results. Article ownership and recent activity also boost an article in the results list. Proximity of Terms—Articles that contain all the keywords in a search are ranked highest, followed by articles with fewer keywords, followed by articles with single keyword matches. Terms that are closer together in the matched document, with few or no intervening words, are ranked higher in the list. Exact Matches—Matches on exact keywords are ranked higher than matches on synonyms or lemmatized terms. Title Field—If any search terms match words in an article title, the article is boosted in the search results. Token Sequence—If the search term is broken up into multiple tokens because it contains both letters and numbers, the system boosts results based on the same sequence of tokens. That way, exact matches are ranked higher than matches on the tokens with other tokens in between.

The Knowledge component helps agents quickly find relevant Knowledge articles for their cases. It also helps perform some basic actions, such as attaching an article to a case. Article Suggestions Suggest relevant articles to agents right in the Knowledge component. Choose between two article suggestion tools: Suggested Articles uses keyword-based search to find relevant articles. It’s automatically enabled when Lightning Knowledge is enabled. Einstein Article Recommendations analyzes past cases and case-article attaches to find relevant articles. It relies on AI features like term overlap, and continually refines its recommendations based on agent feedback and new case data. When it’s activated, all Lightning Knowledge users see article recommendations. Suggested articles are delivered right to the Knowledge component, so agents can find relevant articles without running a search. Suggested articles are automatically enabled when Lightning Knowledge is enabled.

You can publish an article or translation from the Article Management tab or the article’s or translation’s detail page. To publish in Classic Knowledge, you need the publish permission on an article's article type and the “Publish Articles” or “Publish Translated Articles” article action to publish an article or translation. To publish in Lightning Knowledge, you need the associated User Profile perms. When publishing articles keep the following in mind. You can choose to publish directly or schedule publishing for a future date and, optionally, time. Articles you scheduled for publication later continue to appear in the Draft Articles filter, now with the pending icon (an orange clock) next to the article title in Salesforce Classic. To see the publication date, hover over the icon. The pending icon isn’t available in Lightning Experience. Tip To cancel a scheduled publication, click Cancel Publication on the article or translation detail or edit page. Publication times occur in 15-minute intervals, therefore we cannot guarantee publication will match the exact time you specify. A scheduled article’s pending icon isn’t supported for list views. The pending icon is shown only in Salesforce Classic’s Article Management tab. The Cancel Publication button isn’t available from a draft article in Lightning Experience. An article in an approval process might be sent to a queue to be published even if it is scheduled to publish immediately. This happens when the article is very large, there are many active languages, or there are many other articles to publish at that time. To mitigate performance issues, the article is sent to a queue until it can be published successfully, usually within minutes. Also, note that the Last Modified By field shows Automated Process as the last user to modify the article. If the draft being published is a working copy of a currently published article, it is published as a new version of the original. For articles and translations that have already been published, select the Flag as new version checkbox to make the new article icon display next to your article in the selected channels. Readers from these channels can see that this article has been modified since the last time they’ve read it. This checkbox is not available when you publish an article for the first time, as the icon displays by default for new articles. If you assign an article that is scheduled for publication, you also cancel the scheduled publication. Scheduling a publication removes any assignment information. The user who scheduled the publication is assigned to the article. Conflicts might occur when different agents perform actions on the same articles simultaneously. Depending on who performs the action first, the articles will not be available for subsequent users though the articles still display momentarily in the articles list. Performing an action on these articles results in a conflict error.

Click the Article Management tab and select Translations in the View area. Select Draft Translations . Note You can also edit a published translation. It reverts to draft status until you republish it, although you can choose to keep the existing version published while you update it. Optionally, change the Assigned To filter to view articles that are not assigned to you for translation. For example, you want to view articles assigned to a translation queue. Click Edit next to the article and language you want to translate. Enter your translation. Click Save . See Also Salesforce Knowledge Help and Resources "

Article Version Comparison is a component you can add to your Lightning pages. We recommend creating a tab in your layout for this tool so it’s available for your team when they need it. For the best experience, view an older version and then choose a newer version to compare. Content that's new in the compared version is green and underlined. Content deleted from the current version appears in red strikethrough text. Considerations Keep these considerations in mind when you compare articles. The HTML tags show because the source code is used in the comparison. By comparing the HTML source, you can see differences in formatting and image or video links, indicating content that changed. Articles are compared character by character. For instance, “Online” and “Archived” share an ‘i’ and ‘e’. You can use the Article Comparison component only for versions with the same record type and language. In Lookup fields, the linked record’s 18-character ID appears, such as the ID to identify users in Modified By and Created By fields. If another version is modified, created, or deleted while you view an article, it doesn't appear in the version dropdown. You can refresh the page to see the latest list of article versions.

You don't receive a warning when code is removed. Lightning Knowledge supports more styles than Salesforce Classic. For example, when you use the style attribute in Lightning Experience, only the following attributes are removed: background-image, position, and z-index . Your Salesforce admin can choose whether rich text fields load automatically when users edit an article. To load the rich text editor automatically, go to Setup Knowledge Settings and enable Automatically load rich text editor. Some types of content are removed when rich text fields are used with other features, like when you share Knowledge articles in communication channels. For example, emails don't support embedded videos and conversations via chat, social posts, and messaging support only plain text. Table properties like cell width or row height can prevent users from seeing the contents in table cells. For example, images that are too wide for the table aren't shown. You can adjust the table properties until the content appears, such as by setting the width to 100% instead of a fixed value or reducing the image size. The rich text editor loads in an iframe. To load the editor correctly in an iframe, your browser must use appropriate security settings.

Smart links use more characters than what is displayed in the editor. If you see an error that you have surpassed the character limit, have your administrator increase the limit. Smart links in Experience Cloud sites must use the Article Content component. Smart links don’t resolve properly when using custom components. If you don’t select a language, Salesforce returns articles in your org’s default language when you search for an article to link. For legacy Knowledge subscriptions, smart links are based on the channels they’re in. Therefore, legacy customers can’t add a smart link to an article in another channel. For example, an article on a public knowledge base can’t link to an article published only on internal channels. For new Knowledge customers, every article is part of an internal channel, so this qualification doesn’t apply. "

To add a link to a Knowledge article within Salesforce, use Smart Links. When you want to publish a link in an external resource, use the format described here to create a static article link. A static link persists across versions and is based on the article’s URL name, your Salesforce domain, and a few other pieces of information. Warning If you change the URL name in the article record, you must update any links using the original URL name. Open a text file to construct the URL. Open the article that you want to create a link for. In the browser window with your article, copy your Salesforce domain from the address bar into the text file. For example, in the URL https://example.lightning.force.com/lightning/o/Knowledge__kav/list?filterName=00BB00028DpSU , the domain is example.lightning.force.com. In the text file, append the path for the Lightning Knowledge article after your domain. For example, after your domain string, add /lightning/articles/ KnowledgeBaseName / , where the Knowledge base name is the label for the object that contains your articles. By default, the label is Knowledge. If your domain ends in .com , your URL now looks like this: https://example.lightning.force.com/lightning/articles/Knowledge/ In the article record, locate the URL Name field, and copy the contents to the end of your new URL. Note The article URL is case-sensitive, so confirm that the /lightning/articles/ KnowledgeBaseName / portion of the URL and the capitalization of your article’s URL name is correct. The static URL looks something like this: https://example.lightning.force.com/lightning/articles/Knowledge/My-knowledge-article Specify the article’s language using the ISO code. The format for adding the language parameter string is: SalesforceDomain /lightning/articles/ KnowledgeBaseName / URLName ?language= xx_XX For example, if the URL name is shipping-faq and you want to link to the version in French, your static URL looks like this: https://example.lightning.force.com/lightning/articles/Knowledge/shipping-faq?language=fr_FR If the URL name is different for each language, use the version-specific name and don’t add the language code.

Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Before you add languages to your knowledge base, decide for each language whether you want to translate articles directly in Salesforce or export articles to a translation vendor. Communicate your decision to the people involved in the translation process (authors, reviewers, translation managers, publishers). Different languages can use different translation methods. For example, you may want to export articles to a localization vendor for French translations, but assign articles to an internal Knowledge user for Spanish translations. When adding a language to your knowledge base, keep in mind that it can't be deleted; however, you can hide a language by making it inactive. Deactivating a language means it no longer appears as a choice in the New Article dialog or the Submit for Translation dialog. Also, if articles are already published in the language, those articles are no longer visible to readers when the language is deactivated. To hide translated articles for a specific language, deselect Active next to the language on the Settings page. Support a Multilingual Knowledge Base Reach a global audience by offering your knowledge base in multiple languages. Export Articles for Translation If your organization sends Salesforce Knowledge articles to a vendor for translation, use the Export Articles for Translation feature in Setup. Import Translated Articles If your organization sends Salesforce Knowledge articles to a vendor for translation, use the Import Article Translations feature in Setup. You can only import articles that have been exported from the same Salesforce organization. For example, you can't export articles from your test or sandbox organization and import them into your production organization. Set Up Primary Article and Translation Side-By-Side View Look at a translated article and do a side-by-side comparison with the primary language version of the article.

You can use data categories to control access to a particular set of articles, questions or ideas. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Data categories are available in all editions with Knowledge except Professional Edition. Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Note Since the Summer '20 release, standard Salesforce sharing for Lightning Knowledge is available. Switching to standard sharing changes how you work with data categories and how users can access Knowledge articles. See Sharing Considerations for Lightning Knowledge for more about sharing for Lightning Knowledge. The default maximum number of data categories is 100. If you require more than the allocated default maximum, you can ask Salesforce Support to increase the data category limits for the number of (active) data category groups, and the number of data categories within a group. Salesforce Knowledge uses data categories to classify articles and make them easier to find. For example, to classify articles by sales regions and products, create two category groups: Sales Regions and Products. The Sales Regions category group could consist of a geographical hierarchy, such as All Sales Regions as the top level and North America, Europe, and Asia at the second level. The Products group could have All Products as the top level and Phones, Computers, and Printers at the second. Data Category Limits Details Maximum number of data category groups and active data category groups 5 category groups, with 3 active at a time Maximum number of categories per data category group 100 categories in a data category group Maximum number of levels in data category group hierarchy 5 levels in a data category group hierarchy Maximum number of data categories from a data category group assigned to an article 8 data categories from a data category group assigned to an article Data category assignments for translated articles Data categories can be added only to the primary article. Data categories for translations are inherited from the primary article and can’t be added. In an answers zone, data categories help organize questions for easy browsing. Each answers zone supports one category group. For example, if you're a computer manufacturer you might create a Products category group that has four sibling categories: Performance Laptops, Portable Laptops, Gaming Desktops, and Enterprise Desktops. On the Answers tab, zone members can assign one of the four categories to each question and then browse these categories for answers to specific questions. Example Logical Classification of Articles As a knowledge base administrator, you can organize your knowledge base articles into a logical hierarchy and tag articles with the attributes that are significant to your business. Easy Access to Questions As an answers administrator, you can choose which data categories are visible on the Answers tab. Zone members can tag a question with a category, which makes finding questions and answers easier for other members. Control of Article and Question Visibility As a knowledge base or answers community administrator, you can centrally control the visibility articles or questions by mapping roles, permission sets, or profiles to categories in the category groups. When an article or question is categorized, users with visibility can automatically see it. Article Filtering As a support agent, when articles are classified into logical categories, you can quickly and easily locate the article you need by filtering your organization's knowledge base. To ensure you see all relevant articles, filtering by category has expansive results that include a category's upward and downward relatives in the category hierarchy. For example, if your category hierarchy for products has the levels All Products > Computers > Laptops > Gaming Laptops and you are helping a customer with a laptop problem, filtering by Laptops returns articles classified with Laptops as well as articles classified with Computers, All Products, or Gaming Laptops. Effectively, you are made aware of useful related articles like a free shipping offer for all products or an upgrade offer for gaming laptops. (To prevent irrelevant results, category filtering doesn't return nonlineal relatives like siblings and cousins. Articles about Desktops, a sibling of Laptops, would not display.) Article and Question Navigation As an end user, you can navigate the categories on the Articles tab or Answers tab to find the information you need to solve your problem. Managing Category Groups for Articles and Questions If your organization has Salesforce Knowledge and an answers community, you can create separate category groups or use the same category group for articles and questions. Data Categories in Articles A category group is the container for a set of categories. In Salesforce Knowledge it corresponds to the name of the category drop-down menus. For example, if you use the Data Categories page in Setup, (enter Data Category in the Quick Find box, then select Data Category Setup) to create and activate a category group called Products, a Products menu displays on the Article Management tab, the article edit page, the Articles tab in all channels, and the public knowledge base. As an illustration, the figure below shows a knowledge base administrator's view of an article about laptop deals; using the article edit page, the administrator has classified the article with Laptops in the Products category group, and USA in the Geography category group. An Article About Laptop Deals on the Article Management Tab The next figure now illustrates an agent finding that same article published on the Articles tab; the agent has selected Laptops and USA respectively in the Products and Geography drop-down menus to retrieve an article that is classified with both Laptops and USA. An Article About Laptop Deals on the Articles Tab When you add categories to a category group, you build a hierarchy that can contain up to five levels of depth and up to 100 categories total. Each category can have one parent, many siblings, and many children. A robust and well-organized category hierarchy helps users find the articles that are relevant to them quickly and easily. By default, all Salesforce Knowledge users have access to all categories; however, you can restrict category visibility by role, permission set, or profile. Data Category Implementation Tips Consider the following information when planning and implementing data categories for your organization: You can create up to three category groups with a maximum of five hierarchy levels in each group. Each category group can contain a total of 100 categories. If you want to use data categories with Answers, after creating your category group you must assign it from Setup by entering Data Category Assignments in the Quick Find box, then selecting Data Category Assignments under Answers. You can only assign one category group to an answers community. Salesforce Knowledge supports multiple category groups. Category groups are hidden from users until they are activated. Do not activate a category group until you have finished defining its categories and their access settings, including their visibility. When assigning categories to articles, you can choose up to eight categories in a category group. If an article has no categories, it displays only when you choose the No Filter option in the category drop-down menu. When searching for articles or article translations, selecting a category automatically includes the parent and children of that category and any grandparents, up to and including the top level. Sibling categories are not included. For example, if a category hierarchy has the levels All Products, Switches, Optical Networks, and Metro Core, selecting “Optical Networks” from the category drop-down menu returns articles assigned to any of the four categories. However, if the Switches category has a sibling category called Routers, selecting “Optical Networks” does not return articles classified within Routers. Category visibility settings may limit the specific articles you can find. Once visibility settings have been chosen for the categories: Users who are not assigned visibility can only see uncategorized articles and questions unless default category visibility has been set up. For role-based visibility, Customer Portal users and partner portal users inherit the category group visibility settings assigned to their account managers by default. You can change the category group visibility settings for each portal role. If you only have access to one category in a category group, the category drop-down menu for that category group does not display on the Articles tab. You can translate the labels of categories and category groups using the Translation Workbench. Best Practices for Data Categories Consider the following tips when using data categories: To quickly manage data categories, use keyboard shortcuts. After creating or updating categories, set up category group visibility rules. Save your changes frequently. The more actions you perform before clicking Save, the longer it takes to save. Keyboard Shortcuts for Data Categories Use keyboard shortcuts to work quickly with data categories. Create and Modify Category Groups Category groups are used by Salesforce Knowledge (articles), answers (questions), or ideas. In all cases, category groups are containers for individual data categories. For example, a Contracts category group sometimes contains Fixed Price, Cost Reimbursement, and Indefinite Delivery categories. Delete and Undelete Category Groups Deleting a category group deletes all of its categories and removes all associations between the categories and articles or questions. Read this entire topic carefully to understand the consequences of deleting category groups. Add Data Categories to Category Groups Once you have category groups, you can add data categories to help agents classify and find articles, questions, or ideas. Modify and Arrange Data Categories Modifying and arranging categories can result in long processing times, changes to the visibility and categorization of articles, and other significant consequences. Read this entire topic carefully before modifying categories. Delete a Data Category Deleting data categories can result in long processing times, changes to the visibility and categorization of articles and questions, and other significant consequences. Read this entire topic carefully before deleting categories. Activate Data Categories on Your LWR Site Data categories are an organizational structure for your internal knowledge and catalog items, which helps you classify, discover, and show the most relevant article, question, or idea to your users. Add the Network Data Category Object Page (Beta) Quickly add the Network Data Category object page to your LWR site. Manage Data Categories on Your LWR Site After your data categories are activated on your LWR site, you can customize how they appear to site visitors.

From Setup, enter Data Category in the Quick Find box, then select Data Category Setup . Click a category group name. Optionally, click Expand All to display the full category hierarchy, or Collapse All to display only the top-level categories. To edit a category’s name or its unique API name, double-click it. Use drag-and-drop editing to reposition a category in the hierarchy. As you drag, a red icon indicates an invalid destination, while a green icon indicates a valid destination. Drag a category on top of another category to reposition it as a child of the destination category. For example, drag USA on top of North America to make USA one level below North America. After dragging, the category displays below the other child categories at that level. Drag a category to a line that borders another category to reposition it as a sibling of that category. For example, to position USA between Canada and Mexico, drag it to the line between Canada and Mexico. To reorder a category's children in alphabetical order, hover your cursor over its name, then choose Order Child Categories Alphabetically from the Actions dropdown list. This reorder only affects the first-level children, not grandchildren or deeper levels. As you modify the category hierarchy, click Undo to cancel your last actions. Similarly, click Redo to step forward through your flow of performed actions. Click Save . You receive an email when the save process completes. The save process recalculates these visibility and category settings: The contents of the category dropdown menu The articles and questions visible to each user The articles and questions associated with categories. Note Save your changes frequently. The more actions you perform before clicking Save, the longer it takes to save. Example How Changing the Hierarchy Affects Article Visibility Changing the category hierarchy potentially changes which articles readers can see. In the example shown in the following graphic, the category PDAs moves from the original parent category Computers to the new parent category Consumer Electronics. Note When a category moves to a new parent category, users that have no visibility on the new parent category lose their visibility to the repositioned category. Move the Category “PDAs” To understand how this change affects which readers can see articles classified with the PDAs category, review the following table. When my role, permission set, or profile is mapped to: Could I see PDA articles in their old location under Computers? Can I see PDA articles in their new location under Consumer Electronics? Why? All products Yes Yes When your role, permission set, or profile is mapped to the top-level “All products” category, you can see everything in the category hierarchy. Computers Yes No You don't have access to the branch of the category hierarchy where PDAs is now located. Consumer Electronics No Yes PDAs has moved to the branch of the category hierarchy where you have been granted access. How Changing the Hierarchy Affects Article Classification Classifying an article with a parent category implicitly grants access to that category's children. You cannot explicitly apply both a parent category and one of its children to an article. From the article edit page, selecting a parent category grays out its child categories—you cannot select them in addition to the parent category. Salesforce respects this fact when you move a category to a new parent. It prevents explicitly adding a child category to an article when the new parent category is already present. In the example depicted above, the category PDAs moves from the original parent category Computers to the new parent category Consumer Electronics. As a result, the classification for each article can change. Articles formerly classified with both Consumer Electronics and PDAs lose PDAs, because having Consumer Electronics now implies having PDAs. Articles formerly classified with only Consumer Electronics but not PDAs do not change. Access to PDAs is now implied. Articles formerly classified with only PDAs, but not Consumer Electronics, retain PDAs. Loading "

Data category visibility determines the individual data categories, categorized articles, and categorized questions that you can see. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Data categories are available in all editions with Knowledge except Professional Edition. Salesforce Knowledge is available in Essentials and Unlimited Editions with Service Cloud. Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Note Since the Summer '20 release, standard Salesforce sharing for Lightning Knowledge is available. Switching to standard sharing changes how you work with data categories and how users can access Knowledge articles. The View All Records permission works only when standard sharing is enabled for Knowledge. See Sharing Considerations for Lightning Knowledge . Three types of visibility are available. With custom data category visibility, you can see only the data categories permitted by their role, permission sets, or profile. All Categories: All categories are visible. None: No categories are visible. Custom: Selected categories are visible. Visibility Setting Enforcement To ensure a wide range of relevant information, category group visibility is broadly interpreted. Setting a category as visible makes that category and its entire directly related family line—ancestors, immediate parent, primary children, other descendants—visible to users. For example, consider a Geography category group with continents such as Asia and Europe at the top level, various countries at the second level, and cities at the third level. If France is the only visible category selected, then you can see articles classified with Europe, France, and all French cities. In other words, you can see categories that have a direct vertical relationship to France but you can’t see articles classified at or below Asia and the other continents. Note Only the first-level categories in the category group are visible on the Answers tab. In the Geography example, only the continent categories appear on the Answers tab; therefore, if France is the category selected as visible in category group visibility settings, zone members can see questions classified with Europe. Category group visibility settings are enforced on the Answers tab, Article Management tab, Articles tab in all channels (internal app, partner portal, Salesforce.com Community, and Customer Portal), and the public knowledge base. In the following areas, users only see the categories that their visibility settings allow: On the Article Management tab, when creating or editing articles On the Article Management tab and the Articles tab, the category dropdown menu for finding articles On the Answers tab, the categories listed below the zone name Initial Visibility Settings If role, permission set, or profile data category visibility hasn’t been set up, all users can see all data categories. However, if data category visibility is set, users with no data category visibility by role, permission set, or profile, only see uncategorized articles and questions unless you make the associated categories visible by default. Role, permission set, and profile visibility settings restrict default visibility settings. For example, if a data category is visible by default, it isn’t seen by a user whose role restricts access to that data category. Note If data category visibility is defined with roles, permission sets, and profiles, Salesforce uses a logical OR between the definitions to create a visibility rule for each user. Role-Based Visibility Setting Inheritance Child roles inherit their parent role's settings and are kept in sync with changes to the parent role. You can customize and reduce the child role's visibility, but you can’t increase it to be greater than that of the parent role. By default, Customer Portal users and partner portal users inherit the category group visibility settings assigned to their account managers. You can change the category group visibility settings for each portal role. Because high-volume portal users don't have roles, you must designate visibility settings by permission set or profile before these users can view categorized articles and questions. Categorized Article Visibility User’s can see an article if they can see at least one category per category group on the article. For example, consider an article that is classified with California and Ohio in the Geography category group and Desktop in the Products category group: If you have visibility on Ohio and Desktop (but not California), you can see the article. If you don't have visibility on either California or Ohio but do have visibility on Desktop, you don’t see the article. If you have visibility on California but not Desktop, you do not see the article. Revoked Visibility Data category visibility can be revoked (set to None) for a particular category group. Users in the target role, permission set, or profile can only see articles and questions that aren't classified with a category in that category group. For example, if a user’s visibility for the Geography category group is revoked and has visibility only to the Products category group, the user sees only articles classified under the Products category. You can assign an answer zone to only one category group. So if you assign the Geography category group to the answer zone, and revoke a member's visibility for the group, the member can only see uncategorized questions. For a detailed example, see Category Group Article Visibility Settings Examples . How Category Visibility Differs from Other Salesforce Models These settings are unique to articles and questions and differ from other Salesforce models Category Group Visibility on Roles The Category Group Visibility Settings related list summarizes which categories users in the role can see, according to category group.

These settings are unique to articles and questions and differ from other Salesforce models: Exclusive to articles and questions Category group visibility settings determine who can access articles and questions. Although they are standard objects, articles and questions do not have organization-wide defaults, sharing rules, or manual record sharing. Access Category group visibility settings are based on the user’s role, permission set, or profile. Child roles cannot see more categories than their parent role. To change a user's visibility to categories and therefore categorized articles and questions, you must change the visibility settings for the user's role, permission set, or profile , or, if custom data category visibility is not assigned, make certain categories visible to all users . Broad interpretation of visibility settings To ensure a wide range of relevant information, category group visibility is broadly interpreted. Setting a category as visible makes that category and its entire directly related family line—ancestors, immediate parent, primary children, other descendants—visible to users.

All Categories: All categories are visible None: No categories are visible Custom: Selected categories are visible These examples are based on two sample category groups, Products and Geography: Note Although category group visibility settings are available with answers communities (questions) and Salesforce Knowledge (articles), the examples below apply to articles only. Answers communities support one category group and one data category per question. Products Category Group All Products Consumer Electronics Cameras Audio Printers Enterprise Electronics Routers Switches PEX Computers Laptops Desktops PDAs Geography Category Group All Countries Americas USA Canada Brazil Asia China Japan India Europe France United Kingdom Poland Example 1: A Role Hierarchy In this example, the Acme Electronics organization manufactures hardware and provides customer support for both consumers and enterprises. The Engineering department is organized by products. The Support department is organized geographically. Europe and the Americas are managed by corporate teams, but Asia is outsourced. Within the corporate and outsourced teams, there are subteams dedicated either to consumer or enterprise support. The table below shows the categories visible to each role in the Acme Electronics organization, and states whether the visibility settings are inherited from the parent role or if they are custom visibility settings .

This example has three sample users whose category settings are noted in parentheses. Example: How Category Visibility Settings Restrict What Users See Categories When User 1's visibility is All countries/Computers, the category is: When User 2's visibility is America/All products, the category is: When User 3's visibility is France/None, the category is: All countries/Laptop VISIBLE VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE Canada/Computers VISIBLE VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE USA/All products VISIBLE VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE Europe/Switches NOT VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE Europe/No Categories VISIBLE NOT VISIBLE VISIBLE User 1: The user must be granted visibility in each category that classifies the article, or each category that classifies the article must be visible by default. In this example, User 1 can see Europe, because Europe is the child of All Countries, but he cannot see Switches, because Switches does not belong to Computers. That's why User 1 cannot see articles classified with Europe/Switches. User 2: When a category is made visible to a user through custom settings or is made visible by default, its child and parent categories are implicitly included; therefore, User 2 can see articles categorized with All Countries because it is the parent category of America. He can also see Articles classified with USA because it is the child of America. User 3: If a user has no access to the whole category group, he can only see articles that are not categorized in that group. User 3 cannot see the articles categorized with All countries/Laptop because he has no visibility in the category group that includes Laptop, but he can see articles categorized with Europe/No categories.

Salesforce Knowledge is available for an additional cost in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance , and Developer Editions. For more information, contact your Salesforce representative. Unlike Knowledge in Salesforce Classic, where article sharing is based on data categories, Lightning Knowledge sharing is based on fields within the article. You can create rules to modify access to articles based on most standard and custom fields, including the record type field. For example, allow one group of users to see only FAQs, but let other users see multiple record types like FAQs, product information, and training articles.

Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations. How Do Data Categories Fit In? When you switch to standard sharing, data categories are still used for classifying, filtering, and searching for articles. With standard sharing enabled, data categories no longer control access, so check whether you can simplify or remove any data categories. If you previously created groups of data categories primarily to control access, not filter articles, consider whether to remove or deactivate those groups. For example, sharing rules that use the article’s language or record type can replace groups of categories matching the article’s language, region, or record type. Article Access with Salesforce Sharing Changing the sharing model requires you to rethink your permissions and access strategy. Instead of data categories assigned to user profiles, standard sharing uses ownership, defaults, and rules to determine who can see and edit articles. Sharing and article versions Sharing works at the level of the article version (the Knowledge__kav object) and not the primary article (the Knowledge __ka object). You can configure rules and settings so that an agent or user can access some versions but not others. In contrast, because category sharing affects the primary article, versions always have the same category-based access as that of the primary version. This difference applies to language-based versions and consecutive versions. For example, changing the value in a record between versions can change the result of a sharing rule and therefore grant or remove access. In addition, a user can view only published articles unless their profile has the permissions to view draft and archived articles. Object and app permissions Knowledge object permissions to Create, Read, Edit, and Delete articles, granted via profile permissions, control baseline access. Sharing settings refine access, but they can’t give access to articles the user can’t otherwise view or edit. Currently, object-level View All Records and Modify All Records don’t grant more access. Similarly, app permissions for Knowledge, such as View Draft Articles and View Archived Articles, are enforced regardless of sharing. When the user doesn't have access to the Knowledge__ka object, any code involving Knowledge__kav throws an error. Before you implement anything related to Knowledge__kav , use the Schema describe methods to check if the user has access to the Knowledge__ka object. For example, Schema.sObjectType.Knowledge__ka.isAccessible() Learn More About Enforcing Object and Field Permissions Article owners and translations The user who creates a knowledge article is the owner of the primary article and, by default, all versions. The user who submits an article for translation is the owner of the translation version. When your knowledge base contains translations, make sure that your sharing settings provide translators with access to translations and primary-language article versions. For example, if the sharing for a primary-language article is set to Private, it can prevent translators from accessing the primary-language articles. Access for article authors Setting the organization-wide default to Public Read Only prevents non-owners from performing authoring actions such as editing or restoring archived articles. Write access granted via sharing is required to use these actions: Edit, Publish, Delete Draft, Assign, Edit as Draft, Archive, Submit for Translation, Restore, and Delete Archived Article. Admin users with Modify All Data permission, which overrides sharing, can still edit articles. Fields Available for Sharing Rules You can create rules using custom fields and most standard fields as criteria. But you can’t use the following fields in sharing rules: Article Type Assignment Date Assignment Due Date Assignment Note File fields Is Latest Version Is Master Language Publication Status Translation Completed Date Translation Exported Date Version Number The Article Type field differentiates articles in Knowledge for Salesforce Classic, while Lightning Knowledge uses Record Type.

The relationship between the request and the object is defined in the underlying screen flow of the fulfillment related to the catalog item the request is based on. Additional user questions with an attachment type become related to the request and its related items via a ContentDocumentLink record.

Ensure you’ve completed those permissions assignments and that you’re assigned the Service Catalog User permission set before you proceed.

Required Licensing Because your site is an extension of your Salesforce org that provides end users access to your Service Catalog through Experience Cloud, each persona also requires Experience Cloud permissions assignments.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with the Einstein for Service and Customer Service Catalog add-on licenses. Actions in Service Catalog have a specific processing and output framework compared to standard Einstein Copilot actions. Here are a few details to keep in mind. Standard Actions and Service Catalog Actions Einstein Copilot uses standard actions to accomplish key tasks in Salesforce, such as summarizing records. Service Catalog actions complete catalog item requests for customers in your help site so they don’t have to search your catalog or contact support. Service Catalog actions aren’t included in the Einstein Copilot Actions page with the rest of the standard actions. To use actions in Service Catalog, you must create custom actions using the Einstein Copilot custom action guided setup and selecting Service Catalog Item as the reference action type. The Service Catalog Item reference type provides Service Catalog specific processing and outputs for all your catalog items. When the reference action type is selected, you then choose which catalog items to turn into actions. Important Service Catalog Copilot actions are built in the custom action guided setup for use in Setup. Setup and use of Service Catalog actions in your self-service site and digital channels aren't available. Actions, Items, and Outputs Actions tell Einstein Copilot how to accomplish tasks for users. In Service Catalog, an action is associated with a catalog item. Einstein Copilot uses the LLM to identify a catalog item that resolves the customer's contact reason and then uses an action to execute the item for the customer. Einstein Copilot removes the need for customers to search the catalog or contact support. For example, if a customer asks Einstein Copilot for help with updating their phone number or email, an action associated with a catalog item for the related service is called that executes the item for the customer. Item execution is where Copilot provides the item to the customer using one of these methods. Execution Method What’s Provided to the User (Copilot Output) Actionable A Service Catalog request ID for the item Shareable A URL link to the catalog item in your Service Catalog site Items provided to customers as Service Catalog request outputs are actionable by Copilot. An actionable item means Copilot executes the item for the customer by opening a Service Catalog request and then provides them a recordID for the request. Items provided as URL outputs are shareable by Copilot. In this execution method, Copilot generates and shares a URL for the catalog item in your site that customers request on their own. What Determines the Output? All catalog items require a fulfillment that contains one of these flows: Autolaunch, Orchestration, or Screen. Each flow type is associated with one of the execution methods, which then determines the output type. Here’s a table outlining the Copilot output types for Service Catalog items based on the flow included in their fulfillment. These outputs apply to any item that has an action associated with it. Flow Included in Fulfillment Execution Method Copilot Output Autolaunched Actionable A record ID created for the catalog item request formatted as a 27-digit string with letters and numbers Orchestration or Screen Shareable A URL link to the catalog item in your Service Catalog site Here's a summary of Copilot processing in Service Catalog. Getting Started with Service Catalog Actions We’ve provided three catalog items for common contact reasons that are available for download. See Access the Sample Catalog Items . Update Email Address Update Phone Number Open a Support Case Each item contains an autolaunched flow, which makes them actionable by Copilot. The outputs are Service Catalog requests in the form of a record ID. The provided sample items expedite your Einstein Copilot setup for Service Catalog. These items are associated with actions of the same name that are automatically populated in the Einstein Copilot custom action guided setup. Service Catalog actions are set up like custom actions, but they’re ready for you to use right away, with no configuration required. To access the sample Service Catalog items and associated actions, download the sample items, launch the Einstein Copilot actions guided setup, and then select Service Catalog Item as the Reference Action Type. Then choose which catalog items to turn into actions in the Reference Action field. See Build Service Catalgo Actions (Beta) . Actions for Other Items in Your Catalog To use Einstein Copilot for other items in your catalog, you can create custom actions using the Einstein Copilot actions guided setup. All published items in your catalog automatically populate in the model's Reference Action field so you can quickly create custom actions. However, you must specify the instructions for the actions and its input and output settings. See Best Practices for Einstein Copilot Action Instructions . As you build actions for your catalog items, be sure to keep the flow, execution method, and output type parameters presented above in mind.

In this flow, you build a help center that lets visitors search for and view Knowledge articles and contact you using a web form. Where to Access the Setup Flow This flow is available from the Help Center setup page in Lightning Experience with Essentials Edition. If you’re using a different edition, the flow is available from Service Setup in Lightning Experience. You can get to Service Setup by clicking the gear icon and selecting Service Setup. In Service Setup, you can find recommended setup flows, content, and tips based on what you’ve set up already. If you don’t see the setup flow you’re looking for, you can click View All to see the full list. Select the tile to launch the flow. What Does This Flow Do? In this setup flow, we walk you through: Creating a domain Giving your help center a name and path Creating or selecting topics to display in your help center Selecting your article authors Creating a contact form If you select Publish my help center in the flow, you opt for immediate publication and your help center is live. If you left it off, it’s not live yet. You can publish from the Experiece Builder whenever you’re ready. We also turn on several things in the background during the setup flow. Lightning Knowledge: We turn on Lightning Knowledge if you haven’t already. If Lightning Knowledge already is enabled, make sure that you’ve specified “Knowledge” as the name of your Knowledge base. Knowledge Objects: We create some objects in Lightning Knowledge to get you started. A Knowledge record type named FAQ A page layout named Lightning Knowledge FAQ Layout Custom fields Question and Answer Permission Set with Authors Permissions Assigned to Users To make sure your article authors can write and publish articles, we make a permission set for the users you select in the setup flow. We give them the correct permissions for them to view, create, edit, and delete articles and give them the Edit Knowledge user permission. The permission is called Knowledge LSF Permission Set (with the developer name Knowledge_LSF_Permission_Set ). We also give your authors the Knowledge User license and add data category group visibility to their profiles. Mapping Topics and Data Categories When you create topics in the flow, a lot goes on behind-the-scenes to connect those topics to your help center and Knowledge articles (even if you haven’t written them yet). Your help center uses topics, data categories, and data category groups to make sure that your customers can find your articles. Data categories and data category groups let you organize your articles so your customer can do less searching. For example, you might have a data category group called US Regions, which includes the data categories West, Midwest, South, and Northeast. So when you write an article that lists the locations and hours of your stores on the west coast, you would select the West category. If you don’t have any active data category groups when you start the flow, you create topics during the flow. We use those topic names to create data categories and put those categories in a data category group called Help Center Setup Flow. Then, we create featured and navigational topics in your help center and map them to the data categories, so your topics appear in your help center, and relevant articles show up when a customer clicks on a topic. If you already have some data categories when you start the flow, we go through a similar process. You select the data categories you want in your help center, and we map them to topics. We also create a data category group called Help Center Setup Flow. Community with the Help Center Template Your help center is powered by Communities, which lets you create branded spaces for your employees, customers, and partners to connect. A help center is a special type of community that gives you just what you need for a self-service page, without advanced features like user logins and collaboration. With your help center, you get access to Experience Builder and Experience Workspaces, where you can add branding and arrange and manage your topics. Guest User Profile Everyone who visits your help center is a guest user. We create a guest user profile that lets them view your data categories and record types (like your articles). We also give them the right permissions so they can log cases using the web form that you create in the flow. Web-to-Case and Quick Action Edit Capabilities When you create a contact form, Web-to-Case and Quick Action edit capabilities are automatically enabled. This means that when you publish your help center, guests can submit cases directly from your help center. Help Center Setup Flow: What’s Next?

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions What Is PSR? What Is AgentWork? PSR (PendingServiceRouting) is a Salesforce object that gets created when work is routed using Omni-Channel. PSR is a transient object that contains routing information about a work item that is in the midst of being routed. The system automatically creates the object and deletes the PSR when an agent accepts the work item. Omni Supervisor shows PSRs in its Queues Backlog and Skills Backlogs tabs. AgentWork is a Salesforce object that automatically gets created when the routing system finds a potential agent to handle the work item. It contains information about the work item and the routing status. This object is never automatically deleted, but you can manually delete it when the State field is in a non-active state. (Active states are Assigned and Opened. All other states are considered non-active states.) Why Should I Care? When a record’s owner is assigned to an Omni-Enabled Queue, or the record is routed via the Omni-Flow Route Work action, a PSR record is created automatically. You can also use Apex to manually create and update this record for more complex use cases not supported in flows, such as finely-granular prioritization, especially when reopening, transferring, or reassigning work. However, doing so isn’t recommended unless absolutely necessary. What Is the Basic Lifecycle? In the simplest scenario, a PSR record is created when a work item is routed using Omni-Channel. When the system finds a potential agent to handle the work item, an AgentWork record is created. When an agent accepts the work item, the system deletes the PSR record. The system never automatically deletes the AgentWork record, but the record can be deleted manually when it enters a non-active state (such as Closed, Unavailable, Declined, Canceled, Transferred). What Is the Detailed PSR and AgentWork Lifecycle? To fully understand the lifecycle of these two objects, refer to this state diagram. In addition to the creation and deletion of PSR and AgentWork records, this diagram describes the PSR.IsPushed state and the AgentWork.Status value in different phases of the lifecycle. The PSR record is transient whereas the AgentWork record sticks around until it's explicitly deleted. Why does AgentWork contain multiple work records for the same work? Each time a work item is assigned to an agent, a record is created in AgentWork. For example, if an agent transfers a work item to another agent, two records exist–one for each agent. If the work is assigned to a new agent but the original agent keeps the work open, AgentWork contains multiple active records for the work item–one for each agent. AgentWork can have multiple work records for the same agent and work item if the work item is routed to the same agent multiple times. When is the AgentWork record set to Closed? An AgentWork record isn’t closed until one of these events happens. For tab-based capacity, a record closes when the assigned agent closes the work tab. For status-based capacity, the record closes when the work has a completed status or the work is reassigned. If After Conversation Work is enabled, the work closes if the After Conversation Work period ends. Why isn’t a work item in a queue assigned to an agent in Omni-Channel? Work isn't assigned to an agent if the queue doesn't have a routing configuration. Without a routing configuration assigned to the queue, Omni-Channel doesn’t route work items in the queue. What are the usage and limits for PSR records for my org? You can view the number of Pending Service Routing records that are currently in use in your org, as well as the current hourly use rate. From Setup, enter Omni-Channel in the Quick Find box and select Limits . The Limits page also displays the current Pending Service Routing record usage percentage and the Pending Service Routing record limits for your org. "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Note Implement this feature in one click with the Service Setup Assistant: Learn more Omni-Channel routes work through two separate processes. First, when a new work item is assigned to an Omni-Channel queue, Omni-Channel attempts to route it to an agent. Omni-Channel routes work items by the priority of the queue that they’re assigned to, so the most important work items are pushed to agents first. Next, items are routed based on how long they’ve been sitting in the queue. The oldest work items are pushed to agents before more recent ones. (Let’s talk about the details of how that happens in a minute.) Second, when an agent’s ability to receive work changes (perhaps they come back from “away” status, or they finish another work item), Omni-Channel tries to find work that can be routed to that agent. Routing New Work Items When a work item is created, it gets assigned to a queue. If that queue is associated with a Routing Configuration, it’s added to a list of items that are still waiting to be routed to agents. Then Omni-Channel determines which agents are available and how much work each agent is working on. This information comes from the UserServicePresence API object, which tracks an agent’s current capacity for work items. Routing Pending Work Items When a new work item is added to the list of pending items, Omni-Channel determines whether it can immediately route the work item to an agent. First, Omni-Channel identifies if any agents are online with a Presence Status that’s linked to the correct Service Channel. Let’s say your organization receives a new case that’s assigned to an Omni-Channel queue. Omni-Channel determines if there’s a Service Channel for cases. Then it checks which agents are online with a status that lets them receive new work items. Scenario What Happens No agents are available. If there isn’t an agent online who has the right status, Omni-Channel keeps the work item in the list of items that need to be assigned to an agent. Agents are available, but don’t have capacity for new work. If there are one or more agents who are available, Omni-Channel checks to see if any of those agents have the capacity to take on a new work item. If there are no agents with enough capacity for more work, it leaves the work item in the list. Agents are available and have capacity for more work. If there are agents that 1) are available and 2) have capacity to work on the item, Omni-Channel checks which agent to send the work to based on your organization’s routing settings. If your routing configuration uses the Least Active routing model , Omni-Channel looks for the agent who currently has the least amount of work compared to other agents who could take on the work item. It then routes the work item to that agent. If your routing configuration uses the Most Available routing model , Omni-Channel looks for the agent who has the largest gap between the maximum amount of work that they can handle and the amount of work that they are working on. It then routes the work item to that agent. But what if there’s a tie between two or more agents? In that case, Omni-Channel routes the work to the agent who received a work item the longest ago. Suppose that Agent A received work 10 minutes ago and closed it 2 minutes ago. Agent B received work 8 minutes ago and closed it 5 minutes ago. In this situation, the work would go to Agent A. When an Agent’s Ability to Receive Work Changes When an agent logs in to Omni-Channel, finishes a work item, or changes status, Omni-Channel checks to see if there is any work that it can route to the agent. Scenario What Happens The agent is away. Omni-Channel looks for another agent who can take the work. The agent is available, but doesn’t have capacity for work. Omni-Channel looks for another agent who can take the work. The agent is available and has capacity for more work Omni-Channel looks at the list of work items that are waiting to be routed to an agent. It checks to see if the agent is qualified to work on any of the objects, based on how much of the agent’s capacity the objects will take up, and the service channel that’s associated with the agent’s status. For example, if the agent is online with a status that makes them available for cases, it checks the list to see if there are any cases. If the list has work items that the agent is qualified to work on, then the item with the highest priority is routed to the agent. If two or more items have the same priority, the oldest one is routed. Rerouting a Work Item Sometimes an agent declines a work item or changes their presence status and are no longer available to accept work. In that case, the work item is rerouted until it finds a qualified agent. Here’s what happens. First, Omni-Channel automatically changes the owner of the work item to the queue from which the object was originally routed. If an agent (Agent A) declines a work item, then Omni-Channel looks for another agent (Agent B) to route it to. However, the work item can be routed to Agent A again if Agent B declines it. If an agent changes their status and is unavailable, then Omni-Channel looks for another agent to route the work to. Omni-Channel repeats this process until the work item is routed to a qualified agent. Assignment Rules, Auto-Response Rules, Escalation Rules, and Workflow Rules Automation rules, such as assignment, auto-response, escalation, and workflow rules, aren’t triggered when Omni-Channel routes a work item to an agent and the agent accepts the work.

With skills-based routing, route every work item to the agent who has the right skills to solve the problem. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud To implement skills-based routing, you define logic that determines the skills needed to route work items and identify each agent’s skills. To define logic that determines the skills needed to route work items, use one of these methods. Route work using an Omni-Channel flow. Omni-Channel flow offers the greatest flexibility and features not available with skills-based routing rules. With a flow, you can define skill requirements dynamically for each work item and run skills-based routing rules. See Route Work Items to Skills . Route work using skills-based routing rules. See Routing with Skills-Based Routing Rules . To assign skills to agents, define each agent skill, and then assign them to agents. To assign a skill to an agent, assign the skill to a service resource and then assign the service resource to the agent. If an agent isn't assigned a service resource, the agent doesn't appear in Omni Supervisor when they're offline. How Does Skills-Based Routing Work? For a work item that requires specific skills, Omni-Channel routes the item to an agent who has all of the requisite skills and who has available capacity to take on the work. How Does Skills-Based Routing Differ from Queue-Based Routing? Skills-based routing allows work items to be routed using more sophisticated and dynamic criteria than queue-based routing. Prepare to Route to Skills Before you set up routing to skills, review the skills-based routing limitations, set up Omni-Channel, and complete these prerequisite tasks.

For a work item that requires specific skills, Omni-Channel routes the item to an agent who has all of the requisite skills and who has available capacity to take on the work. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud When routing a work item, Omni-Channel determines the required skills based on the routing configuration, skills-based routing rules, and Omni-Channel flow. Skills defined in the routing configuration are added to all work items routed using that configuration. Skills defined in a skills-based routing rule or Omni-Channel flow are added if the work item meets the specified criteria. To match the right agent, Omni-Channel compares the required skills for the work item against the skills assigned to agents. When a work item is routed to a skill that multiple agents have, the work item is routed to the first available agent based on the routing type (most available or least active). Skills are evaluated when a record, such as a case, is added to an Omni-Channel queue. If you edit a record that’s in an Omni-Channel queue, any changes to skills aren’t reflected until you reassign the record to the queue or to another queue. If a work item requires certain skills, but no agents have those skills, the work item isn’t routed. This situation is similar to how items in a queue are treated when no agents are online. If you use Omni Supervisor , a supervisor can look at the Skills Backlog tab to see which work items that require a skill haven’t been assigned to an agent. Additional Skills You can define additional skills to go along with primary skills. For example, you might define Solar Panel installation as a primary skill and Spanish as an additional skill. Initially, Omni-Channel tries to route work to an agent with all the requested skills. If an agent with all the skills isn't available and additional skills are configured to be dropped, Omni-Channel drops additional skills after a timeout. The router drops skills until an agent who has the remaining skills is available. You can specify the order in which additional skills are dropped. Skills with a higher priority are dropped first. For example, a skill with priority 5 is dropped before a skill with priority 4. Skills with priority 0, or skills without a priority, are dropped last. The work item is then routed to the best-matched agent, even if the agent doesn't have all the additional skills. If an agent declines work or goes offline, the required skills reset to what they were originally, and the timer resets. The router goes back to looking for agents with all additional skills and begins the process of dropping additional skills over again.

When your customer initiates a chat, voice, or messaging conversation, launch an Omni-Channel flow to route the work item to a queue, skills, agent, or bot. Create an Omni-Channel Flow Create a flow from scratch. Or, get a headstart by creating one from an Omni-Channel flow template. The templates illustrate how to create flows that route chats, voice calls, and messages to agents, queues, and skills. You can also use a template to create a case for each inbound call. You can customize flows built from templates to meet your business needs. Create Cases for Inbound Calls with an Omni-Channel Flow Template Save yourself time setting up this routing logic by using the Basic Routing with Case Creation template. This template identifies the caller, routes the call to a queue, creates a case for the call, and screen-pops the new case record when the agent accepts the call. If needed, modify the Omni-Channel flow to change the default routing behavior, such as the queue. Assign an Omni-Channel Flow to a Chat Button Route chats to the best agent dynamically using the Omni-Channel routing type and Omni-Channel flows. Assign an Omni-Channel Flow to a Phone Channel Your contact center can have multiple phone channels that your customers can call, such one for Support and another for Sales. Each channel has its own phone number. To route calls in a phone channel, create the channel in the contact center and then specify the routing method for the channel. To dynamically route calls with an Omni-Channel flow, assign the flow to the channel. Assign an Omni-Channel Flow to Route Cases from Email-to-Case Route cases from your customer support emails to qualified agents with an Omni-Channel flow. Invoke an Omni-Channel Flow to Route Non-Real-Time Objects To route non-real-time objects, such as cases, leads, and custom objects, define the routing logic in an Omni-Channel flow, and then invoke the flow from a parent flow based on your business rules. For example, to trigger the flow to run when cases are created, add it as a subflow in a record-triggered flow. Or, to perform a custom transfer process, add it as a subflow in a screen flow.

When your customer initiates a chat, voice, or messaging conversation, launch an Omni-Channel flow to route the work item to a queue, skills, agent, or bot. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud To see some possibilities of routing with an Omni-Channel flow, look at a sample flow. In the previous example, the flow runs at the start of a chat conversation. The Get Records element obtains the customer’s Contact record. The Decision element checks that record for the customer’s language. The flow then executes the appropriate Route Work action based on the customer’s language. Route work to Queue 1 for an English-speaking agent or to Queue 2 for a French-speaking agent. Route Work actions are the last elements in a flow. Use them to route work to queues, agents, or skills. To understand how to route a work item, Omni Channel identifies the routing information specified in the service channel details. To route work items using an Omni-Channel flow, you have to create the flow and then assign it to the service channel. To see an example about how to assign an Omni-Channel flow to a phone channel, see Create a Phone Channel . "

Or, get a headstart by creating one from an Omni-Channel flow template. The templates illustrate how to create flows that route chats, voice calls, and messages to agents, queues, and skills. You can also use a template to create a case for each inbound call. You can customize flows built from templates to meet your business needs. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud In the Quick Find box under Setup, enter Flows , and then select Flows under Process Automation. Click New Flow . Click All + Templates . To filter the flow types to Omni-Channel flows, select Omni-Channel Flow in the left pane of the New Flow screen. To create a flow from a template, select one of the following templates. Omni-Channel Flow Template Description Basic Routing with Case Creation Creates a case for each inbound call. Chats Routed to Agents and Queues Routes each chat to an agent or queue based on conditions that you define. Chats Routed to Agents with the Right Skills Routes each chat to an agent with the required skills based on conditions that you define. Voice Calls Routed to Agents and Queues Routes each call to an agent or queue based on conditions that you define. Messages Routed to Agents and Queues Routes each message to an agent or queue based on conditions that you define. To create a flow from scratch, click Omni-Channel Flow . Click Next . Create these variables to store values in your flow. Variable Resource Type Description recordId Variable Stores the ID that uniquely identifies the work record being routed. For example, if the flow routes a voice call, it stores the voice call ID. input_record Record (Singles) Variable Stores the work record that’s being routed, including all fields and input values. For example, if the flow routes a chat, it stores the entire chat record from the Chat Transcript object. Add at least one Route Work action to route the work. Route Work actions are the last objects in the flow. Click Save . About Flow Variables Create the following variables to store values in your flow: recordId, skillList, prechat, and input_record. RecordId is required. SkillList, prechat, and input_record are optional based on your flow logic. Add Screen Pops to Give Agents More Context about Conversations By default, only the primary work record opens when an agent accepts a work item. But, with more context, agents can provide more personalized service for each customer. To automatically open records or screen flows on the agent’s screen when a voice call, message, or chat is routed to the agent, include an Add Screen Pop action in the Omni-Channel flow. You can open up to a total of three records or screen flows. For example, you can show the customer’s case and contact records and open the Channel-Object Linking screen flow as a subtab. Make Smarter Routing Decisions by Checking Agent Availability Optimize routing by using information collected about your organization’s capacity to handle new work requests. Add the Check Availability for Routing action to an Omni-Channel flow to determine agent availability and estimated wait time. This action can return the number of online agents and number of work items waiting to be picked up given the specified routing requirements, including routing type and parameters. It can also estimate how long the customer has to wait before they reach an agent. You can then build routing logic based on the results. For example, if the agent has more than five backlogged work items in their queue, you can route work to another queue instead. Route Work Items to Queues Automatically route work to a specific queue using variables. Route Work Items to Skills Automatically route work items to qualified agents who have specific skills. In the Omni-Channel flow, attach the skill requirements to the work items. Route Work Items Directly to a Specific Agent Automatically route work items directly to an agent using Direct-to-Agent routing. Route Work Items to an Enhanced Bot Automatically route conversations to an enhanced bot using enhanced Messaging channels, based on your business criteria. Loading "

But, with more context, agents can provide more personalized service for each customer. To automatically open records or screen flows on the agent’s screen when a voice call, message, or chat is routed to the agent, include an Add Screen Pop action in the Omni-Channel flow. You can open up to a total of three records or screen flows. For example, you can show the customer’s case and contact records and open the Channel-Object Linking screen flow as a subtab. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Note The Add Screen Pop action doesn’t open records or screen flows when an agent accepts transferred work. For example, Agent 1 accepts a chat. The action opens records on the agent’s screen. Agent 1 transfers the chat to Agent 2. When Agent 2 accepts the chat, the action doesn’t open any records or screen flows on Agent 2’s screen. Screen pops don’t work with apps that use standard navigation. Screen pops work only if an agent is accepting work from an app using console navigation. Under the Elements tab of Flow Builder, drag the Add Screen Pop action onto the canvas. Give the action a label, API name, and, optionally, a description. In the Set Collection Variable, optionally, select the output of the previous Add Screen Pop action to combine those screen pop instructions with the ones created by this action. For more information, see Using Multiple Add Screen Pop Actions in an Omni-Channel Flow . In Screen Pop Type for Record, select the ID field of the record you want to open. Or, enter the specific record ID value. If multiple records open on the agent’s screen, toggle Focus to put this record in focus for the agent. For example, to open the contact record, select the contact record variable (which contains output from the Get Contact element), and then select the contact ID field. Note The order in which you define the records is the order in which they open on the agent’s screen. If you don’t set the focus, all records open, but the agent’s screen focuses on the primary work record. In Screen Pop Type for Screen Flow, select Screen Flow as the Type to choose from a list of active screen flows. Or, select Resource as the Type to choose your own flow variable. The list of active screen flows shows a maximum of five flows, but you can search for other flows by typing in the Screen Flow Name field. Resources appear only for valid and active screen flows and for fully qualified flow API names, including the name space prefix. To open another record or screen flow, click Add Screen Pop . You can open up to three records or screen flows. Click Done . Don’t forget to pass the screen pop instructions (the output from this action) as input to the Route Work action. Only screen pop instructions passed to the Route Work action are used to open records when the work is routed to the agent. To add the screen pop instructions as input to a Route Work action, open the Route Work action. In the Screen Pop Collection Variable field, select the output from the Add Screen Pop action, and then select routingInteractionInfoList . Tip Use the Debug option in Flow Builder to validate this Add Screen Pop action along with the other elements in the Omni-Channel flow. Using Multiple Add Screen Pop Actions in an Omni-Channel Flow You can chain multiple Add Screen Pop actions together in the same flow. For example, add one action to open records regardless of which queue or agent the work is routed to. Then, add another action to open additional records based on who the work is routed to. Store Screen Pop Instructions in a Variable If you add multiple Add Screen Pop actions to a flow, define a collection variable to aggregate and store all screen pop instructions. By storing all instructions in a variable, you don’t have to worry about the order in which the Add Screen Pop actions are added to the flow. To understand why order is important if you don’t use a variable, consider this scenario. You create a flow that passes the output of Screen Pop 1 to Screen Pop 2, and then passes the output of Screen Pop 2 to the Route Work action.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud To send screen pop instructions from all Add Screen Pop actions to the Route Work action, pass the instructions from each Add Screen Pop action to the next one in the flow. Then, pass the last Add Screen Pop action’s instructions to the Route Work action. To understand how this process works, let’s look at an example. This sample flow accepts the customer order number as input from the IVR. The first Add Screen Pop action opens the contact and account records for the caller. If the caller provides an order number, the second Add Screen Pop action opens a third record, the order record associated with the order number. The screen pop instructions from first Add Screen Pop action (1) is passed to the second Add Screen Pop action (2). The second action passes the aggregated instructions from both Add Screen Pop actions to the Route Work action. To pass the instructions from the first Add Screen Pop action to the next, in the Set Collection Variable field of the second Add Screen Pop action, select the output from the first Add Screen Pop action. In general, use this variable to append the output from the previous screen pop action and pass the results to the Route Work action. Next, pass these screen pop instructions from the second Add Screen Pop action to the Route Work action. Only the screen pop instructions passed to the Route Work action open records when the work is routed to the agent. Important All Add Screen Pop actions combined can open a total of three records. If they’re set up to open more than three, the flow stores the screen pop instructions for the first three records and ignores the rest. Also, you can enable the Focus toggle for only one record in an Add Screen Pop action. If the Focus toggle is enabled for multiple Add Screen Pop actions, the last-defined Focus setting takes precedence. Tip If you add multiple Add Screen Pop actions in a flow, define a collection variable to store all screen pop instructions. "

Optionally, to assign the output of this flow action to variables so they can also be used downstream in the Omni-Channel flow, expand the Advanced section, select Manually assign variables , and then select the variable for each output. The action can return these results. Output Description Estimated Wait Time (in seconds) The action returns the estimated wait time (in seconds) given the specified routing parameters. For example, if you route work to a queue, this parameter shows the estimated time that the work can remain in the queue before an agent picks it up. Omni-Channel recalculates estimated wait time based on work routed during the last 10 minutes. If less than 10 items were routed, we can’t calculate it. Wait times are calculated based on primary (not interruptible) work items in the queue. Interruptible work isn’t included in the calculation. Number of Online Agents The action returns the number of agents who are online but not necessarily available to accept more work—they could be working at capacity. If you route to an agent, this value is 0 (the agent is offline) or 1 (the agent is online). If you route to a queue, this value is the number of online agents assigned to that queue. If you route to a skill, this value is the number of online agents who have the specified skillset. Number of Queued Work Items The action returns the number of items waiting to be picked up, which excludes items assigned to or accepted by agents. If you route to an agent, this value is the number of PSRs directly assigned to the agent without a fallback queue. If you route to a queue, this value is the number of PSRs assigned to the queue, including PSRs assigned to a specific agent with this queue as the fallback queue. If you route to skills, this value is the number of PSRs that share the exact same set of mandatory skill requirements, both skill and skill level, used in the action. Queue size is calculated based on primary (not interruptible) work items in the queue. Interruptible work isn’t included in the calculation. To make a routing decision based on the results of this action, add a Decision element to the Omni-Channel flow. In the Decision element, define the expected routing for different conditions. For instance, if at least one agent is online and the queue size is less than or equal to 10, route cases to the queue using a Route Work action. To route work based on the estimated wait time, output the time in a Check Availability for Routing action of an Omni-Channel flow, and use that output as input for the routing logic in a Route Work action.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Follow the steps to create an Omni-Channel Flow . Drag the Add Skill Requirements action onto the canvas. Give the action a label and API name and optionally, a description. Under Set Input Values, optionally select a skillList variable that you created. This variable stores and aggregates skills as the flow runs. Under Add Skill Requirement, enter the skills or a variable with the Skill IDs that the agent needs. You can specify a skill level, whether the skill is additional, and a priority. Initially, Omni-Channel tries to route work to an agent with all the requested skills. If an agent with all the skills isn't available and additional skills are configured to be dropped, Omni-Channel drops additional skills after a timeout. The router drops skills until an agent who has the remaining skills is available. You can specify the order in which additional skills are dropped. Skills with a higher priority are dropped first. For example, a skill with priority 5 is dropped before a skill with priority 4. Skills with priority 0, or skills without a priority, are dropped last. The work item is then routed to the best-matched agent, even if the agent doesn't have all the additional skills. If an agent declines work or goes offline, the required skills reset to what they were originally, and the timer resets. The router goes back to looking for agents with all additional skills and begins the process of dropping additional skills over again. If you aggregate skills in a skillList variable as the flow runs, in the Advanced section, set that variable as output of the Add Skill Requirements action. A subsequent Route Work action can use the output from your Add Skill Requirements action to define skills that agents need for work items. For example, if the API name of an Add Skill Requirements action is AddSkill, specify that action’s outputs, {!AddSkill.skillRequirements}, in the Route Work action. If you aggregate skills in a skillList variable, specify it as output of your Add Skill Requirements action and as the skill requirements list in your Route Work action. "

For example, to route product-return calls to the right agents, map the case type field value, Product Return, to the Returns Processing skill. Required User Permissions User Permissions Needed To set up Omni-Channel: Customize Application Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud Create one skill mapping set for each object. In each mapping, associate an object’s picklist, boolean, and lookup field values with the skills needed to route a work item to the right agent. You can map up to 10 fields and 100 field values. You can also specify the skill levels. To route a work item more quickly, specify whether a skill is additional and can be dropped if needed. From Setup, enter Skills-Based Routing Rules in the Quick Find box, then select Skills-Based Routing Rules . Click New Skill Mapping Set . Provide a name and developer name for the mapping set and select the type of object to be routed. Then click Next . Select the fields for routing your cases. Then click Next . You can map standard and custom field values of type picklist, boolean, and lookup. Note You can use any method to set custom field values on objects. For example, pre-chat forms, triggers, and custom apex code. For each field, select the field value and corresponding skill. You can also specify a skill level and set skills to additional. For additional skills, you can specify the order in which skills are dropped if after the specified timeout no agent with that skill is available. Initially, Omni-Channel tries to route work to an agent with all the requested skills. If an agent with all the skills isn't available and additional skills are configured to be dropped, Omni-Channel drops additional skills after a timeout. The router drops skills until an agent who has the remaining skills is available. You can specify the order in which additional skills are dropped. Skills with a higher priority are dropped first. For example, a skill with priority 5 is dropped before a skill with priority 4. Skills with priority 0, or skills without a priority, are dropped last. The work item is then routed to the best-matched agent, even if the agent doesn't have all the additional skills. If an agent declines work or goes offline, the required skills reset to what they were originally, and the timer resets. The router goes back to looking for agents with all additional skills and begins the process of dropping additional skills over again. For example, you can set up the following required and additional skills: Language: English and French are required, not additional. Issue Type: Software and Hardware are additional skills of the highest priority, 0. Product: Speaker, Mouse, and Keyboard are additional skills of priority 1. Location: USA, England, Canada, and France are additional skills of priority 2. In this example, Language skills aren’t additional, so they’re never dropped. Skills associated with the Issue Type field are the highest priority, so Omni-Channel drops them last. Skills associated with the Location field are dropped first. Note Skills with the same priority value resulting from the skill-based routing rules setup method or Apex code belong to the same group and are dropped together. When you have mapped field values to skills for each field, click Done . To create a mapping set, click New (1). To edit or delete a mapping set, use the dropdown menu (2). To stop routing for an object, click Deactivate . To start routing for an object, click Activate . To test the routing setup, navigate to your app and bring the agent with the right skill online. Create a work item with the field value that maps to the corresponding skill. Change the owner of the work item to a queue with the routing configuration that you set up for skills-based Routing rules. The work item appears in the Omni-Channel component. Routed work appears in the Queues Backlog and Skills Backlog in Omni-Channel Supervisor. Mapping only happens when the work is routed, not when a record’s values are updated. Loading "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions To use Omni-Channel with a third-party telephony solution, two options are available. Set up your telephony solution with Service Cloud Voice and use Omni-Channel routing to route calls. For example, you can set up a contact center with Amazon Connect or other telephony provider, and Service Cloud Voice allows Omni-Channel to route calls for it. Implement external routing and integrate your provider’s routing engine with Omni-Channel routing Routing with Service Cloud Voice When you deploy Service Cloud Voice with your telephony solution, Omni-Channel can blend calls with work items from Salesforce channels such as messaging, chat, or cases. When a customer calls, Omni-Channel identifies the correct queue for the voice call. It passes routing instructions with that queue destination to the telephony provider’s routing engine, which maintains similar queue and agent configurations. Using the instructions that Omni-Channel provides, the routing engine then directs the call to the intended agent. This approach lets you build routing rules across all channels in one place. Because Service Cloud Voice interfaces to the telephony solution, Omni-Channel provides agents and supervisors with an experience similar to that of a native Salesforce channel. For agents, voice calls appear in the Omni-Channel component just like other channel work items. In Omni Supervisor, supervisors oversee teams and workloads across channels, including voice. Reports and dashboards reflect work items across all contact center channels. With Omni-Channel flows, you can do more than route work to the right agents. Flows centralize business rules across your channels and let you orchestrate next steps in the support process. For example, a flow can link contacts, route to a bot, suggest knowledge articles, or screen-pop related records to your agents. External Routing If you have a partner channel solution, it’s tempting to push routing decisions to that solution’s routing engine and use Salesforce and Omni-Channel tools for agents and supervisors. While it’s possible to implement external routing, it requires integration support from the channel provider and custom code. External routing requires an application that uses Salesforce standard and streaming APIs to connect to the provider’s routing engine. The application requests work and agent availability details from Omni-Channel to make routing decisions. After the provider’s routing engine determines work assignments, it must pass that information back to Salesforce so that agents receive the work. This table summarizes differences between the two approaches for routing voice calls. Characteristic Routing with Service Cloud Voice and Omni-Channel Flows External Routing with Omni-Channel Flows Unified agent experience in the Omni-Channel component. Support for automation such as screen pops that present related cases or contacts. Yes No Unified supervisor experience and insights across multiple channels. Yes No Unified reports and dashboards across all channels. Yes No Implementation complexity. Low High: Requires partner support and custom code. Loading "

Define less pressing work items as interruptible so that Omni-Channel can route more urgent work to agents right away. Available in: Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can designate work items as either primary or interruptible. A primary work item is one that is considered uninterruptible. Voice phone calls and chats are examples of tasks that shouldn’t be interrupted. An interruptible work item, by contrast, can be put aside in favor of more immediate work. A case that takes a long time to resolve is an example of an interruptible work item. Similarly, you can define agents’ primary and interruptible capacities—how much uninterruptible and interruptible work, respectively, that each agent can handle at a time. When Omni-Channel routes work, it looks at a work item’s size and interruptibility and then searches for agents whose available capacities suit that work item. As an example, suppose agents can handle one voice call and four cases at a time. Assuming each work item is one unit of capacity, set the agent’s primary capacity at one work item and their interruptible capacity at four work items. Configure service channels so that voice calls are uninterruptible and cases are interruptible. If Omni-Channel assigns four cases to an agent, that agent is at full capacity for interruptible work and isn’t offered another case. But when a voice call, which is primary work, comes in, Omni-Channel sees that the agent still has available primary capacity and assigns the call. Here’s a summary of Omni-Channel routing rules with respect to primary and interruptible capacity. When the Work Is ... … Omni-Channel Follows These Rules Primary (Uninterruptible) Omni-Channel assigns a primary work item only if the agent has available primary capacity. When routing uninterruptible work, Omni-Channel doesn’t consider interruptible work that’s assigned to the agent. Interruptible When routing interruptible work, Omni-Channel considers only those agents who have both sufficient primary and interruptible capacity. This way, if an agent is busy with primary work such as a phone call, Omni-Channel doesn’t assign interruptible work that the agent can’t get to. Examples For the following scenarios, assume that agents can handle up to five leads and five cases at a time, so primary and interruptible capacities are set to five relative work units. Each lead or case consumes one unit of work. In the respective service channels, we set leads as uninterruptible and cases as interruptible. Agent Erika is working on five cases, so she has no available interruptible capacity. She’s 100% available, though, for uninterruptible leads. When Omni-Channel receives a lead, it sees that Erika has available primary capacity and assigns the lead. Agent Lucas is working on five leads, so he has no available primary capacity. He has no cases, so he’s 100% available for interruptible work. When Omni-Channel receives a case, it checks if Lucas has both enough primary and interruptible capacity for the work item. Because Lucas has no primary capacity, Omni-Channel looks for another agent who has capacity of both types available. Setting Up Interruptible Capacity Before Omni-Channel can route work items based on interruptibility, you must do the following: Set up agents’ work capacities. See Set Up Agents’ Capacities . Set up work items as primary or interruptible. See Configure Work Items as Primary or Interruptible . To view primary and interruptible capacity for each agent, go to the Agents tab.

Create Service Channels Service channels let you turn nearly any Salesforce object―such as a case, lead, SOS session, or even a custom object―into a work record. Omni-Channel then plucks these work items from their queues―like flowers from the garden of agent productivity―and routes them to your agents in real time. Add the Omni-Channel Component to an App To give agents easy access to Omni-Channel, add it where they work—in a Lightning app. Go Mobile with Omni-Channel Omni-Channel users can complete work from their mobile device. With Omni Mobile, a mobile version of Omni-Channel, an agent can set their status and handle work requests from all enhanced channels, with the exception of Voice. They also receive notifications on their mobile device about new work, updates to work, and changes to their status. Omni Mobile is part of the Salesforce mobile app, which can be installed on mobile devices. Set Up Omni Supervisor Use Omni Supervisor to monitor agent workloads and the status of work items that are routed by Omni-Channel. Agents can raise flags on work items when they require assistance from a supervisor. Supervisors can monitor Service Cloud Voice transcripts and chat messages between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the support agent sees. Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly. Set Up Agents In Omni-Channel, set up agents to complete work requests.

In a queue, priority is determined by how long the work item has been waiting—first in, first out. However, while a work item is pending in the queue, new work can come in that is more urgent. See Set Up Secondary Routing Priority . Enable Status-Based Capacity Model Measure agent capacity based on the status of accepted work rather than the open tabs and sessions. If agents are unavailable, their work remains assigned, and reflected in their capacity, until the work is completed or reassigned. See Set Up a Status-Based Capacity Model . Define login behavior when an agent using Omni-Channel opens a new window or tab Each agent can be logged in to only one Omni-Channel session at a time. For example, if an agent is logged in to Omni-Channel on one browser tab, logging in to Omni-Channel in a second tab terminates their active session, and they lose all in-progress work. To define the behavior when an agent opens Omni-Channel on another tab or window, select one of these options. Automatically log agents in to Omni-Channel in the new window or tab . In this case, agents are logged out of the original sessions, terminating any in-progress work. Warn agents in a popup that open tab-based work will be terminated . In this case, the agent can choose which Omni-Channel session to log in to. Don’t automatically log agents in to Omni-Channel on a new window or tab (Recommended). In this case, the agent remains logged in to the original session, ensuring that any in-progress work isn’t terminated. The agent isn’t logged into the new session. When Omni-Channel Fallback Mode is enabled, this login setting is ignored. In this case, the Don’t automatically log agents in to Omni-Channel on a new window or tab option is always used. The in-progress work that is terminated upon logging in to a new window or tab includes active voice calls. When on-call agents open Omni-Channel on another tab or window, call information does not appear in the new instance. Enable Enhanced Omni-Channel Enable Enhanced Omni-Channel to access features such as paused work, the Omni-Channel Wallboard, the Omni-Channel sidebar layout for the Omni-Channel component, and an improved agent UI experience. We don’t develop new features for Standard Omni-Channel. See Comparison of Standard and Enhanced Omni-Channel . Salesforce orgs created after Summer '23 have Enhanced Omni-Channel on by default. Turn off Enhanced Omni-Channel if you use standard Messaging or Chat. Enhanced Omni-Channel works with enhanced Messaging. If you turn off enhanced routing, your agents must go offline and then reselect a status in the Omni-Channel component. Your Omni supervisors must refresh the screen. Enhanced routing can’t be used with standard Messaging channels, and enabling it deactivates your standard channels. If this happens, reactivate your standard channels by disabling enhanced routing and then refreshing your channel list on the Messaging Settings page in Setup. Important When Fallback Mode is enabled, the Enable Enhanced Omni-Channel option in the Omni-Channel settings is disabled. To disable Enhanced Omni-Channel, Fallback Mode must be disabled. To use Omni-Channel to route messaging sessions to agents, you must also Enable Messaging .

Set Up Secondary Routing Priority Let your agents tackle the right cases first with secondary routing priority. Understand Capacity Models Omni-Channel determines agent capacity in one of two ways: Tab-Based or Status-Based. Set Up a Status-Based Capacity Model Measure agent capacity more accurately with the status-based capacity model. With this model, Omni-Channel determines agent capacity based on the status of accepted work rather than the open tabs and sessions. If agents are unavailable or close their work tabs, their work remains assigned and applied to their capacity until the work is completed or reassigned. Agents can also pause work to be completed later. In contrast, the tab-based capacity model releases an agent’s capacity when a work tab is closed in the service console. Configure Work Items as Primary or Interruptible Make sure that uninterruptible work like a chat goes only to agents with the capacity to handle it. Define uninterruptible work as primary, and long-standing or less-urgent work, like cases or leads, as interruptible. Configure After Conversation Work Time Give agents a set amount of time after a customer conversation to wrap up their work before they start a new conversation. Agents can use this After Conversation Work (ACW) time to send follow-up emails, update a case, or finalize their conversation notes. Supervisors can use Omni Supervisor and reports to track the amount of time agents spend on wrap-up work.

However, while a work item is pending in the queue, new work could come in that is more urgent. For example, transferred work, an item that has been waiting on someone’s response, or work that is about to reach a service agreement deadline. You can shift an item to a different queue, but within that queue, it’s behind older items. Also, some queues might have the same priority. Secondary Routing Priority solves this problem by moving a work item forward in a queue over older items and resolving conflicts across queues for items with the same routing configuration priority. Note When you enable secondary routing, existing work isn't reevaluated. Secondary routing applies to new work opened after this feature is enabled. Also, secondary routing priority doesn’t support voice calls. From Setup, enter Omni-Channel in the Quick Find box, then select Omni-Channel Settings . Select Enable Secondary Routing Priority . You can now configure secondary routing priority mappings for each channel. From Setup, enter Service Channels in the Quick Find box, then select Service Channels . Edit an existing service channel or add a new one. In the Secondary Routing Priority section, select a priority field. Then map field values to priorities. Example To prioritize escalated cases first and new cases next, select Status as the priority field. Then set the Escalated field value to priority 1, and the New field value to priority 2. The highest priority is 0. Note Secondary Routing Priority is not automatically updated for skills-based routed chat and messaging channels. To update the SecondaryRoutingPriority field on the PendingServiceRouting object, use the API.

Tab-Based Capacity Model Determines agent capacity using the number of console tabs that are open in the agent’s Omni-Channel session. When the agent logs out, all the work that’s assigned to the agent is considered closed by Omni-Channel, and the agent's capacity is reset. Omni-Channel also considers the work to be closed when an agent closes the tab that Omni-Channel opened for the work item. Tab-based capacity models aren’t supported in apps with standard navigation. Status-Based Capacity Model Determines agent capacity using the status of work items assigned to the agent. Agents sometimes work on the same work item over multiple days, across multiple Omni-Channel sessions. The status-based capacity model checks the status of a work item to determine if the work consumes an agent’s capacity. If the agent closes a tab or logs out of Omni-Channel, their capacity isn’t reset until the work has a completed status. The status-based capacity model isn’t supported for Voice. An agent can have a maximum of 100 work items open at a time. For tab-based capacity, the maximum is 100 tabs at once. For status-based capacity, the maximum includes work items that are paused or in progress.

Select Enable Status-Based Capacity Model . You can now set up the status-based capacity model for each channel. From Setup, enter Service Channels in the Quick Find box, then select Service Channels . Edit an existing service channel or add a new one. For each service channel, select the Status-Based capacity model. (1) Specify the picklist field that you use to track work status and the field values that you use for completed, paused, and in-progress work. (2) For information on the In-Progress, Paused, and Completed states, see Service Channel Settings . For information on setting picklist values for Status Field, see Add or Update Picklist Values . The Paused state is available only when Enhanced Omni-Channel is enabled. Note For some channels, these values are system-controlled, so mapping picklists in this way isn’t available. Optionally, check one or both of the Check agent capacity checkboxes to determine an agent’s capacity before Omni-Channel reopens or reassigns work. (3) If the agent doesn’t have capacity, the work item is rerouted based on how it was most recently routed. For example, if the work item was routed using queue-based routing, Omni-Channel reroutes the work item to the queue that it was assigned to. For work that’s assigned to a specific agent, leave the Check agent capacity checkboxes blank to override a capacity check and keep the work assigned to the agent. Considerations for Status-Based Capacity Models Keep these factors in mind when using status-based capacity models. Review these considerations before you use status-based capacity. With the status-based capacity model, an agent can be assigned a total of 100 work items. The Omni-Channel component displays the first 20 assigned work items. An additional 20 work items can remain open and assigned, but they don't impact agent capacity. To view additional work items, an agent must close other work items, go offline, and then come back online. A work item consumes agent capacity only if Omni-Channel first assigns the work using queues or skills. Work items created before status-based capacity are enabled don't apply toward agent capacity. To ensure agents have a manageable workload, they must handle assignments exclusively from Omni-Channel. To ensure agents are working on the highest priority work, Omni-Channel prioritizes work for them. If you don't select the capacity checkboxes when you set up status-based capacity, the automation rules aren’t triggered. Voice doesn't support the status-based capacity model.

Define uninterruptible work as primary, and long-standing or less-urgent work, like cases or leads, as interruptible. Available in: Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When agents handle both time-sensitive and long-running work, Omni-Channel can route time-critical work items so that customers receive faster response times. You can define less pressing work items as interruptible so that Omni-Channel can route more urgent work to agents right away. Note LiveChatTranscript records are uninterruptible and always use primary capacity. A field on the work item—the Is Interruptible field on a Pending Service Routing or Agent Work record—determines whether a work item is interruptible. You can set work items as interruptible in any of these ways: from the service channel, from routing settings, or in Apex. Use service channel settings to set work items as interruptible. In Setup, under Omni-Channel Service Channels, select Is Interruptible . For example, configure work in the Case service channel as interruptible and work from the Chat service channel as primary. Use routing configurations to set work items as interruptible. In Setup, under Omni-Channel Routing Configurations, set Capacity Type for routed work items. You can set this field as interruptible, primary, or inherited from the service channel. Use Apex to set the capacity type. In Apex, set the IsInterruptible field explicitly on a Pending Service Routing record or Agent Work record for a work item. If you define an Omni-Channel flow that uses the Route Work action, specify a service channel or routing configuration in the flow. Configure interruptibility in the service channel or routing configuration. Omni-Channel can then set the Is Interruptible field on Pending Service Routing records accordingly. Example Tier 1 agents handle mostly high-priority cases. When they have time, they take cases with lower priorities, too. Define a queue and create a routing configuration for each type of case. In each routing configuration, set the capacity type as Not Interruptible for high-priority cases and Interruptible for lower-priority cases. An Omni-Channel flow looks at an incoming case’s priority and routes the case to the appropriate queue. Omni-Channel then checks the Interruptible field on the Pending Service Routing record and routes the work to an agent who meets the capacity rules. Configure Capacity Weight for Work Items Omni-Channel routes according to both interruptibility and work item size. After you’ve set work items as primary or interruptible, configure their capacity weights. You can set the capacity weight for work items in two ways: in the routing configuration, and in Apex. Important When you define the size of a work item, make sure that it’s smaller than the value that’s set for the primary and interruptible capacities. Otherwise, Omni-Channel can never route that work item. Set the capacity weight for work items in the routing configuration. In Setup, under Omni-Channel Routing Configurations, specify the work item size. Define the size as work units or as a percentage of an agent’s capacity. For example, if an agent has a capacity of six work units and all cases have a capacity weight of two, an agent can handle up to three cases. Alternatively, specify the work item’s required capacity as a percentage. For example, a voice call consumes 100% of an agent’s capacity. When Omni-Channel makes routing decisions, it checks percentages of available primary and interruptible capacity. If you specify work item size using work units, it converts available capacities to percentages to check if the agent has availability that meets the rules. Alternatively, in Apex, set the Capacity Weight or Capacity Percentage field explicitly on these records: Pending Service Routing, Agent Work, Service Channel, and QueueRoutingConfig . Now you’re ready for Omni-Channel to make routing decisions using primary and interruptible capacity.

After Conversation Work doesn’t work with a status-based capacity model . The ACW countdown begins the moment a call or message ends. Agents can exit the countdown early by closing the record or let it run its course. When the time runs out, the agent is considered available to help the next customer regardless of whether they’ve closed the record. If ACW isn’t enabled, agents reserve time for wrap-up tasks by leaving the call record open in the app. When an agent is ready to help the next customer, they must close the record tab to free up their capacity. You can set up ACW in the presence configuration for a group of agents or in a service channel. ACW at the service channel level overrides the setting at the presence configuration level. Configure ACW. From the Service Channels page in Setup, edit or create a channel based on Voice Call or Messaging. Alternatively, from the Presence Configurations page in Setup, edit or create a configuration. In the After Conversation Work Time section, select Give agents wrap-up time after conversations .

For example, open a marketing campaign widget when an agent accepts a lead. Minimize the Omni-Channel widget when work is accepted Automatically minimize the Omni-Channel component when your agents accept work. (Lightning Experience only) Automatically accept work requests Automatically assign work from this service channel to the agent so that they’re not required to manually accept the incoming work item. You can enable this feature at the service channel level (for the entire channel) and presence configuration level (for a group of agents). Enabling this feature at the service-channel level provides you with finer control. For example, you can enable Auto Accept for phone calls, but not chats. When this setting is enabled, where the work appears depends on what tabs the agent has open. For example, if no tabs are open, the work appears automatically in an in-focus tab. If the agent has tabs open, the work opens in the background. If the agent has a tab open for the work already, then that tab comes to the forefront. Override agents’ audio settings Select the sound that agents hear when work from this service channel is routed to them in Omni-Channel. You can play a different sound for each service channel or group of agents. For example, to differentiate the type of work, you can play a ringing sound for incoming calls and a ta-dah sound for incoming messages. Audio settings at the service-channel level override the settings for each agent’s presence configuration. Notification Sound To play the default sound, select Default . To play a custom sound, select Custom Sound , and then select the audio file that’s uploaded to Static Resources . Valid file types are aac, flac, mp3, ogg, opus, and wav. You can also set this option at the presence-configuration level. If you set it at both levels, the service channel setting overrides the presence configuration setting. Sound Length (Seconds) Select how long to play the notification sound. The maximum length is 30 seconds. The sound loops until the maximum length is reached. You can also set this option at the presence-configuration level. If you set it at both levels, the service channel setting overrides the presence configuration setting. If the customer ends the session before the agent joins the conversation, the agent still hears the notification sound for the specified length of time. Secondary Routing Priority Field Use field values to determine the routing priority of work items within and across queues when the queue routing configuration priority is the same. Select a priority field, then assign a priority for each field value. 0 is the highest priority. This option appears when you enable secondary routing in the Omni-Channel settings under Setup. When you enable secondary routing, existing work isn't reevaluated. Secondary routing applies to new work opened after this feature is enabled. Also, secondary routing priority doesn’t support voice calls. Capacity Model Choose either a tab-based capacity model or a status-based model. The tab-based capacity model releases an agent’s capacity when a work tab is closed in the service console. Tab-based capacity models aren’t supported in apps with standard navigation. With the status-based capacity model, work remains assigned and applied to an agent’s capacity until the work is completed or reassigned to a different agent. Agents can also pause work to be completed later. See Status-Based Capacity Model Fields for information on the fields that appear when you choose the status-based model. The Capacity Model field appears when you enable the status-based capacity model in the Omni-Channel settings under Setup. To set the status-based capacity model, see Enable Omni-Channel . Override After Conversation Work settings in presence configuration Overrides the After Conversation Work (ACW) settings in the presence configuration with the service channel settings. Duration (seconds) Indicates how many seconds agents have, from 30 to 3,600, to complete their closing work after a conversation. If Give agents wrap-up time after conversations is selected, this field is required. Let agent extend timer (seconds) Gives agents the option to pause the After Work Conversation timer to prevent being put back into available status before completing after conversation work. Extension duration (seconds) Indicates how many seconds agents have, from 15 to 3,600, to extend their closing work after a conversation. If Let agent extend timer (seconds) is selected, this field is required. Max Extensions Indicates how many times, from 1 to 10, agents can pause the After Work Conversation timer. If Let agent extend timer (seconds) is selected, this field is required. Status-Based Capacity Model Fields These fields appear if you enable the status-based capacity model. To enable status-based capacity, see Enable Omni-Channel . For all channels, except Messaging, map each work status value to an Omni-Channel status: In-Progress, Paused, and Completed. You don’t have to map the statuses for Messaging sessions because these statuses are predefined internally. To see how they’re mapped, view the service channel settings for the Messaging channel. Note The Paused state is only available when Enhanced Omni-Channel is enabled. Field Description Status Field A picklist field on the object, such as a case, that you want to use status-based capacity with. Only fields with a static set of values, like a picklist, can be used with status-based capacity. Specify which values you use to indicate in-progress, paused, and complete status. See Add or Update Picklist Values . Values for In-Progress This work must, and can, be completed right now. Values for Paused This work must, but can’t, be completed right now. For example, the agent is waiting for a customer or partner team to act. Paused is intended for when you want the current owner to complete the work item later. If you don’t care who later completes it, then you can mark it as completed. Values for Completed No more work is anticipated by the current record owner for this item. Check agent capacity on reopened work items When a work item is reopened, and the assigned agent isn’t available, reroute using the most recent routing type. If deselected, assigns the work to the agent even if unavailable. If a work item is in a paused state, it always goes back to the agent. Check agent capacity on reassigned work items When an open work item is reassigned to an agent, and the agent is unavailable, reroute using the most recent routing type. If deselected, assigns the work to the agent even if unavailable. If a work item is in a paused state, it always goes back to the agent. In-Progress, Paused, and Completed are Omni-Channel states. They’re independent of the statuses that an admin creates for an object. As an example, an admin creates statuses on a case called On Hold, Escalated, and New. The admin can assign On Hold as a Paused value, Escalated as In-Progress, and New as Completed. For more information on creating picklist values for an object, see Add or Update Picklist Values . Work item size indicates the amount of an agent’s overall capacity that’s consumed when the agent is assigned the work item.

For example, if your agent receives a request to manage a case, the request features the case’s priority, status, and case number by default. An object’s primary compact layout controls all of the visible fields in the Omni-Channel component. But what if you want to see more information, such as the case’s owner or its subject? Just edit the primary compact layout so that it includes the fields that you want to appear in the Omni-Channel component. Tip There’s only so much room to display fields on work item requests. While you can technically put up to 10 fields on a compact layout, Omni-Channel displays only 4 fields. As a best practice, select up to 4 of the most important fields that you want to expose on work item requests, then add those to your compact layout. Decide which object’s compact layout you want to edit. From the management settings for the object whose work item you want to edit, select Compact Layouts , and then select New . For example, to edit the compact layout for cases, go to the object management settings for cases, select Compact Layouts , then select New . Select the settings for your compact layout, including the fields that you want it to include. The fields that you pick appear in Omni-Channel when an agent receives a request. Click Save . Change the primary compact layout to your new layout by clicking Compact Layout Assignment Edit Assignment . Select your new compact layout from the Primary Compact Layout drop-down list.

Agents can raise flags on work items when they require assistance from a supervisor. Supervisors can monitor Service Cloud Voice transcripts and chat messages between agents and customers, and send helpful messages that only the support agent sees. Supervisors can also respond to incoming support requests by changing queues as needed and can update agent skills quickly. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ), Lightning Experience Omni Supervisor is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Note We recommend using Enhanced Omni-Channel. Enhanced Omni-Channel features better and more extensive experiences for agents and supervisors than Standard Omni-Channel, and future Omni-Channel features are developed on Enhanced Omni-Channel. See Comparison of Standard and Enhanced Omni-Channel and Enable and Configure Omni-Channel . See real-time information about your Omni-Channel agents, queues, and work in the Omni Supervisor panel, including waiting times, open work, and more. Omni Supervisor updates continuously to reflect the most up-to-date data, so that you always know how your agents are doing. Keep an eye on Omni-Channel activity with intuitive tab views that show you the big picture of how your agents are doing. Take advantage of filtering and sorting to help you find what you need. Sort by the flag raise column to see which agents need assistance that you can provide through whisper messages that the agent sees but not the customer.

Show the Default Actions on Omni Supervisor Tabs To enable supervisors to take action from Omni Supervisor, set up the default actions. For example, enable the Change Queues and Change Skills action buttons on the Agents tab so supervisors can change the queues and skills assigned to agents right from where they work. Setting Up Custom Actions on Omni Supervisor Tabs Improve supervisor productivity and contact center efficiency by adding custom actions to Omni Supervisor. For example, add actions that let supervisors send emails or Slack messages to agents, reassign work in a queue, or assign an agent to a different shift. Supervisors invoke these actions on the selected agents, queues, or work items in an Omni Supervisor tab. Change What Supervisors See in Omni Supervisor Use a supervisor configuration to specify which agents, queues, skills, and actions that a group of supervisors see when they’re using Omni Supervisor. The selected agents, queues, and skills filter the data used to calculate the Wallboard metrics. To give your agents more privacy, you can hide the agent timeline from these supervisors. You can also configure which tabs are visible in Omni Supervisor, and in which order, and add custom tabs as well. If needed, you can set up a separate supervisor configuration for each group of supervisors. Create Custom Tabs for Omni Supervisor Take advantage of the power of Omni Supervisor by creating bespoke tabs for supervisors. Embed your own apps, components, or metrics on an Omni Supervisor tab and share your page on the App Exchange, or use the custom tab for your own needs.

The selected agents, queues, and skills filter the data used to calculate the Wallboard metrics. To give your agents more privacy, you can hide the agent timeline from these supervisors. You can also configure which tabs are visible in Omni Supervisor, and in which order, and add custom tabs as well. If needed, you can set up a separate supervisor configuration for each group of supervisors. Required User Permissions User Permissions Needed To set up Omni-Channel: “Customize Application” Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can’t add users to supervisor configurations via roles or “Grant Access Using Hierarchies.” Supervisor configurations only support users who are directly assigned to a public group. From Setup, enter Supervisor Configurations in the Quick Find box, then select Supervisor Configurations . Click New . Enter a name for your configuration. The Developer Name populates automatically. To assign supervisors to the configuration, select users or their profiles in the Which Supervisors Are Impacted? section. A user configuration overrides a user profile configuration. Only users who have a service presence status assigned to them via permission set or profile appear in the Available Users list. Note This configuration doesn’t change the supervisors’ access to agents, queues, or skills. It filters what they see on the Omni Supervisor tabs only. To filter the agents that these supervisors can see in the Agents tab, add at least one public group in the Select Visible Agents section. The members of the public group are the agents that the supervisors can see in Omni Supervisor. These selections also filter the data used to calculate the metrics on the Wallboard tab. A maximum of 2,000 public groups can be shown in the search results. To filter queues from the Queues Backlog and Assigned Work tabs, select at least one queue in the Select Visible Queues section. For example, to provide better support for cases from top accounts, filter the Queues Backlog tab to show only those accounts. These selections also filter the data used to calculate the metrics on the Wallboard tab. When a supervisor changes queues assigned to agents , only the queues specified in their supervisor configuration are shown. If there’s no supervisor configuration for that supervisor, all queues are shown. To filter skills from the Skills Backlog tab, select the skills in the Define Visible Skills section. You also have to specify whether to show work items with at least one specific skill or all specified skills. These selections also filter the data used to calculate the metrics on the Wallboard tab. To show an action in an Omni Supervisor tab, in the Define Actions section, select the tab, and then move the action to the Selected Actions column. The Define Actions section shows system and custom actions. You can add up to 10 actions on each tab. Use the Up and Down arrows to reorder the selected actions. Note If you add a custom action in the supervisor configuration, to see the action in Omni Supervisor, a supervisor either needs the “Run Flows” user permission, the Flow User field enabled on their user detail page, or access to the flow if Override default behavior and restrict access to enabled profiles or permission sets is selected for the flow. To set which tabs are visible in Omni Supervisor, scroll to the Define Visible Tabs section and move tabs to or from the Selected Tabs list. Tabs appear in Omni Supervisor in the order shown in the Selected Tabs list. You can create custom tabs via the Lightning App Builder , using the Omni Supervisor Page page type.

By default, supervisors can view all online agents. Supervisors can also view offline agents, if the supervisors have read access on the Service Resource object. Required User Permissions User Permissions Needed To change the user profile permissions for the Service Resource object: Customize Application Available in: Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Professional, Essentials, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions An offline agent is a user with a Service Resource that is set as Active and has a Resource Type of Agent. (See Service Resource Fields for Field Service .) Supervisors initially can see up to 1,000 offline agents. As agents with a Service Resource defined in this way go offline, they show as additional offline agents. To permit particular supervisors to view offline agents, set the access at the user profile level. From Setup, enter Profiles in the Quick Find box and select Profiles . Select a profile. Click Edit . Scroll down to the Standard Object Permissions section. Enable the Read property for the Service Resources object. Supervisors who have visibility on more than 1,000 agents with associated service resources sometimes see inconsistent numbers of offline agents. For example, consider this scenario. A company has 1,500 Salesforce users, and 300 are online. Omni Supervisor loads the default 1,000 presumed offline users. Next, Omni Supervisor loads the 300 online users. Let’s say 200 users of those 1,000 presumed offline users are online. Omni Supervisor removes the 200 users from the 1,000 presumed offline users and shows 800 offline users and 300 online users. If a user comes online, Omni Supervisor shows that user as online, as expected. If they’re one of the 800 previously offline users, Omni Supervisor now shows 799 offline users. Otherwise it still shows 800 offline users. Setting the access at the user profile level shows all offline agents to supervisors with the profile. To reduce the set of agents shown to the agents that they oversee, create a supervisor configuration.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Basic Information These settings configure the basic functionality that’s available to agents when they’re signed in to Omni-Channel. Setting What It Does Presence Configuration Name Names the presence configuration. This configuration name, or a version of it, automatically becomes the Developer Name. Developer Name Sets the API name for the configuration. Capacity Determines the agent’s maximum capacity for work. The size of the work item that you specified in the routing configuration consumes the agent’s capacity. Interruptible Capacity Sets the maximum amount of interruptible work that an agent can handle at a time. If this value is blank, it defaults to the same value as the Primary Capacity field. Automatically accept work requests Automatically accepts work assignments that are pushed to an agent. These work items open automatically in the agent’s workspace, so the agent isn’t required to accept them manually from the Omni-Channel component. If Allow Agents to Decline Requests is enabled, you can’t use this setting. When this setting is enabled, where the work appears depends on what tabs the agent has open. For example, if no tabs are open, the work appears automatically in an in-focus tab. If the agent has tabs open, the work opens in the background. If the agent has a tab open for the work already, then that tab comes to the forefront. Allow agents to decline work requests Allows agents to decline incoming work items. If Automatically Accept Requests is enabled, agents can’t decline requests. If you configured work to be routed to a specific agent and that agent is required, don’t enable this option. When a specific agent is required, this option isn’t supported. Update Status on Decline Automatically changes the agent’s status to the status that you specify when the agent declines a work item. By default, the status is set to offline for declined voice calls. Service Cloud Voice uses this mechanism to force agents to reset their status when they’re ready to receive calls again. Otherwise, they could continue to receive and miss calls indefinitely. This setting is available only if Allow Agents to Decline Requests is enabled. When you update statuses on declined or missed calls, the agent’s presence status changes, but their Amazon Connect status remains as Missed. We recommend that you set the presence status to Update to Busy or Offline to keep the agent's status in sync with Amazon Connect when they decline or miss a call. Allow agents to choose a decline reason Allows agents to choose a reason when declining work assignments. This setting is available only if Allow Agents to Decline Requests is enabled. Update Status on Push Time-Out Automatically changes the agent’s status when a work assignment that’s been pushed to them times out. By default, the status is set to offline for missed voice calls. Service Cloud Voice uses this mechanism to force agents to reset their status when they're ready to receive calls again. Otherwise, they could continue to receive and miss calls indefinitely. This setting is available only if Push Time-Out is enabled. When you update statuses on declined or missed calls, the agent’s presence status changes, but their Amazon Connect status remains as Missed. We recommend that you set the presence status to Update to Busy or Offline to keep the agent's status in sync with Amazon Connect when they decline or miss a call. Audio Settings These settings configure the notification sounds Omni-Channel uses. Setting What It Does Play a notification sound for work requests Plays a sound in the agent’s Omni-Channel component when a work request is received. Notification Sound To play the default sound, select Default. To play a custom sound, select Custom Sound, and then select the audio file that’s uploaded to Static Resources. Valid file types are aac, flac, mp3, ogg, opus, and wav. You can also set this option at the service-channel level, which overrides the setting here at the presence-configuration level. Sound Length (Seconds) Select how long to play the notification sound. The maximum length is 30 seconds. You can also set this option at the service-channel level, which overrides the setting here at the presence-configuration level. If the customer ends the session before the agent joins the conversation, the agent still hears the notification sound for the specified length of time. Play a notification sound if Omni Channel loses connection Plays a sound in the agent’s Omni-Channel component when the agent loses connection with Omni-Channel. After Conversation Work Time These settings configure how much time an agent has to wrap up work after finishing a conversation. Setting What It Does Give agents wrap-up time after conversations Gives agents a set amount of time after a customer conversation to wrap up their work before they start a new conversation. Agents see the countdown in the After Conversation Work (ACW) component. Duration (seconds) Indicates how many seconds agents have, from 30 to 3,600, to complete their closing work after a conversation. If Give agents wrap-up time after conversations is selected, this field is required. Let agent extend timer (seconds) Gives agents the option to pause the After Work Conversation timer to prevent being put back into available status before completing after conversation work. Extension duration (seconds) Indicates how many seconds agents have, from 15 to 3,600, to extend their closing work after a conversation. If Let agent extend timer (seconds) is selected, this field is required. Max Extensions Indicates how many times, from 1 to 10, agents can pause the After Work Conversation timer. If Let agent extend timer (seconds) is selected, this field is required. Assign Decline Reasons These settings appear when Allow Agents to Decline Requests and Allow Agents to Choose a Decline Reason are selected. Setting What It Does Available Decline Reasons Indicates the decline reasons that are eligible to be assigned to the configuration. Selected Decline Reasons Indicates the decline reasons that are assigned to the configuration. Agent Settings These settings apply to agents in a presence configuration. Setting What It Does Agent Alias (Enhanced Messaging Only) Replaces an actual agent’s name in Enhanced Messaging transcripts. You can create an alias from scratch, such as Support Agent, or use a preset merge field such as First Name, Nickname, or Alias. Setting an agent alias is optional. If set, it applies to all users in a presence configuration. Assign Users Assign eligible users to the configuration to give them access to Omni-Channel functionality. You can also assign profiles to a configuration. If a user is assigned a configuration at the profile and user levels, the user-level configuration overrides the configuration that’s assigned to the user’s profile. Warning Users can be assigned to only one presence configuration at a time. If you assign the same user to a second presence configuration, the system removes that user from the first presence configuration without warning you. So make sure that you know which presence configuration assignment is required for each user. For example, let’s say that User A is assigned to Presence Configuration A. Then you create Presence Configuration B and assign User A to it without realizing that the user was assigned to another presence configuration. Salesforce removes User A from Presence Configuration A and reassigns the user to Presence Configuration B without notifying you. Setting What It Does Available Users Indicates the users who are eligible to be assigned to the configuration. Selected Users Indicates the users who are assigned to the configuration. Assign Profiles Assign eligible profiles to the configuration to give users who are associated with the profiles access to Omni-Channel functionality. If a user is assigned a configuration at the profile and user levels, the user-level configuration overrides the configuration that’s assigned to the user’s profile. Setting What It Does Available Profiles Indicates the user profiles that are eligible to be assigned to the configuration. Selected Profiles Indicates the user profiles that are assigned to the configuration. Loading "

Set their capacities for primary and interruptible work. Agents’ work can be either primary — that is, not to be interrupted, like a Voice call—or interruptible, like a case. By setting up agents’ primary and interruptible work capacities, you give agents the ability to pause long-standing or less urgent work to take on more pressing tasks. For simple setups, in particular setups with a single channel, primary capacity for agents usually suffices. For more complex setups, especially where you want to blend real-time and asynchronous channels, consider interruptible capacity. For more on interruptible capacity, see Prioritize with Interruptible Capacity . In Setup under Presence Configurations, define primary and interruptible capacity. These values represent the maximum amount of primary and interruptible work that an agent can handle at a time. You can specify available capacity using relative work unit values or a percentage. A value is required for primary capacity in the Capacity field. If you define only primary capacity, interruptible capacity is set to the same value by default. Now you’re ready to create primary and interruptible capacity on agents’ work items. See Configure Work Items as Primary or Interruptible .

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Database.com Editions Lead queues and case queues are not available in Database.com Contact requests and service contract queues are available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions with the Service Cloud You can manually add a record to a queue by changing the record’s owner to the queue. Or, an assignment rule can add cases or leads to a queue based on specific record criteria. Records remain in a queue until they’re assigned an owner. Any queue members or users higher in a role hierarchy can take ownership of records in a queue. Example Create a task queue with members who are sales reps following up on pending opportunities. Create a lead queue with members who are sales reps assigned to a specific sales territory. Create a case queue with members who are support agents assigned to different service levels. Create a contact request queue with members who are support agents to resolve customer issues.

If a case doesn’t have a contact, it’s assigned to the default global division. Add which objects to include in the queue. Add queue members. Members can be individuals, roles, public groups, territories, connections, or partner users. Depending on your sharing settings, only queue members and users above them in the role hierarchy can take ownership of records in the queue. Note Keep these considerations in mind when adding queue members: To manage members of a queue that’s mapped to a contact center for voice calls, Messaging sessions, or both, don't use the Queues page. Instead, use the Contact Center details page. For more information, see Manage Contact Center Queues in Salesforce and Your Contact Center or Manage External Routing Queues for a Partner Contact Center . If the Grant Access Using Hierarchies option is unchecked for a public group that you’re adding to a queue, only queue members are added to the queue. If the option is checked, managers of those queue members are also added to the queue. If you add a role and its subordinates to a queue, all users with that role and their subordinates are added as queue members. Anyone above that role is added as managers of the queue members. If you use queues for tasks, keep in mind that emails, notifications, and reminders are sent about task assignments only after the task is reassigned from a tasks queue to a specific user. Work can be routed to queue members only, not their managers. Guest users can’t be queue members. In Salesforce orgs created before February 8, 2024, records that were previously accessible to Roles and Subordinates become available to Roles, Internal and Portal Subordinates when you enable digital experiences. Review queues that contain Roles, Internal and Portal Subordinates members, and replace them with Role and Internal Subordinates as required. Save the queue. If you want, set up assignment rules for your lead or case queues so that records that meet certain criteria are automatically added to a queue.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Basic Information Setting What It Does Routing Configuration Name Names the service routing configuration. This routing configuration name, or a version of it, automatically becomes the Developer Name . Developer Name Sets the API name for the service routing configuration. Overflow Assignee Sets the user or queue that Omni-Channel routes items to when your org reaches Omni-Channel limits. The overflow assignee must be a user or a queue without a routing configuration. Ensure that you: Select a user or queue that has access to the objects handled by the queue or queues using this routing configuration. Assign a routing configuration with an overflow assignee to all Omni-Channel queues involved in a bulk operation, such as changing the status or owner for multiple requests. Routing Settings Setting What It Does Routing Priority The order in which work items from the queue that are associated with this routing configuration are routed to agents. Objects in queues with a lower number are routed to agents first. For example, if you set the priority for highly qualified leads to 1 and the priority for less qualified leads to 2, highly qualified leads are routed and assigned to agents before less qualified leads. On the backend, we identify agents with available capacity, and then we assign work to them based on this priority order. The priority of the queue from which the work item came The amount of time that the work item has been waiting in the queue Members of the queue who are available to receive new work items from the queue When the work item is assigned to an agent, the owner of the object changes from the queue to the agent. If an agent declines the work item, we reassign it back to the queue with its original age so that it can be properly rerouted. Routing Model Determines how incoming work items are routed to agents who are assigned to the configuration’s service channel. Push Time-Out (seconds) Sets a time limit for an agent to respond to an item before it’s pushed to another agent and the first agent’s status is changed accordingly. For inbound Voice calls, your telephony system’s limitations impact the time that agents have to respond to an item before it’s rerouted. Amazon Connect limits this value to 20, and latency on Amazon’s part can result in agents having less than 20 seconds to answer a call before it’s rerouted. When an agent attempts to answer a call within 20 seconds and finds that the call was already rerouted, the agent’s status remains unchanged. If you configured work to be routed to a specific agent and that agent is required, don’t enable this option. When a specific agent is required, this option isn’t supported. Drop Additional Skills Time-out (seconds) Set the time to wait before dropping additional skills from Omni-Channel routing. If set, CustomRequestedDateTime in the PendingServiceRouting object is used as the start time for the timeout. If not set, the start time is based on the time that the pending service request is created. Capacity Type Sets whether a work item is primary (not interruptible), interruptible, or if it inherits the type from the Service Channel settings. This setting is ignored for work items that can’t be interrupted. Skills-Based Routing Rules Setting What It Does Use with Skills-Based Routing Rules Use this routing configuration with Skills-Based Routing Rules. Note: If you use the Omni-Channel Flow, you invoke routing rules from the flow instead. Size for In-Progress Work Items Specify the size of in-progress work items in queues associated with this configuration. The size is valid for tab-based work as well as status-based work. Size items by number of units or percentage of an agent’s capacity, but not both. The Capacity setting in the presence configuration that the agent is assigned to determines the agent’s overall capacity. As agents are assigned work items from the queue, the capacity weight or percentage is deducted from the agent’s overall capacity as long as they have enough capacity to cover the assigned work items. Setting What It Does Units of Capacity for In-Progress Work Items The amount of an agent’s overall capacity that’s consumed when the agent is assigned an in-progress work item from queues that are associated with this configuration. Percentage of Capacity for In-Progress Work Items The percentage of an agent’s overall capacity that’s consumed when the agent is assigned an in-progress work item from queues that are associated with this configuration. Size for Paused Work Items The Paused status is only available when Enhanced Omni-Channel is enabled. Specify the size of paused work items in queues associated with this configuration. The size is valid only if the work uses status-based capacity. Size items by number of units or percentage of an agent’s capacity, but not both. Default consumption is zero, so that when work is paused, the agent can receive additional work items. The Capacity setting in the presence configuration that the agent is assigned to determines the agent’s overall capacity. As agents are assigned work items from the queue, the capacity weight or percentage is deducted from the agent’s overall capacity as long as they have enough capacity to cover the assigned work items.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Omni-Channel is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions In Omni-Channel, work items are automatically routed or “pushed” to agents in the appropriate queue. When you set up a routing configuration, select a routing model option. This option determines how to distribute work items evenly to your agents. The Least Active and Most Available options consider agents’ used or available capacities, respectively. An agent’s overall capacity—how much work the agent can handle at a time—is determined by the presence configuration that the agent is assigned to. You can specify overall capacity using relative work unit values or a percentage. Routing Option Description Example Least Active Incoming work items are routed to the agent whose work is consuming the smallest amount of capacity. If a tie occurs, the work item is routed to the agent who hasn’t received work in the longest time. Agent A has an overall capacity of 5 work units. Agent B has an overall capacity of 10 work units. Agent A has 3 active work items, each with a capacity weight of 1. Agent B has 5 active work items with a capacity weight of 1. Agent A’s used capacity is 3 work units, while Agent B’s used capacity is 5 work units. Because Agent A’s work is consuming less capacity than Agent B’s work, Omni-Channel routes the incoming work item to Agent A. Most Available Incoming work items are routed to the agent who has the greatest amount of available capacity. If a tie occurs, the work item is routed to the agent who hasn’t received work in the longest time. Agent A has an overall capacity of 5 work units. Agent B has an overall capacity of 10 work units. Agent A has 3 active work items with a capacity weight of 1. Agent B has 5 active work items with a capacity weight of 1. Agent A’s available capacity is 5−3=2 work units. Agent B’s available capacity is 10−5=5 work units. Agent B has more available capacity than Agent A, so Omni-Channel routes the incoming work item to Agent B.

You can even see how long your agents have been logged in and when they last accepted new work. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ), Lightning Experience Omni Supervisor is available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions There are two views in the Agents tab: All Agents and Agents by Queue. All Agents Subtab All Agents lets you see the big picture of your agents’ availability, capabilities, capacity, and workload. It’s the default for the Agents tab because it provides the best overall picture of how your agents are doing. Agents logged into Omni-Channel appear in rows, where you can see their status, channels, queues, workload, and capacity. Here, you can also change an agent’s status using the Action column as long as they’re not offline. If you select Offline, keep in mind that the agent’s work isn’t tracked anymore. To see more nuanced information about how an agent is doing, select the agent. You can view the Agent Detail and, unless disabled, Agent Timeline views. The Agent Detail view provides details about an agent’s activity and timestamps. The Agent Timeline view displays the agent’s status changes and work via an intuitive calendar view. The Agent Timeline shows the AgentWork status, not the status of the work item record itself. When an agent accepts an AgentWork Item and then closes the tab, the AgentWork status is changed to Closed . Agents by Queue Subtab The Agents by Queue subtab provides information about how well your queues are covered. Every queue that has at least one agent that’s Online or Away is shown. You can see how many agents are assigned to the queue and how many of them are online, away, or idle. This graph lets you see if you must rearrange agents to make sure your incoming work is covered.

When you add an agent to a new queue, they remain assigned to their previous queues as well. For telephony providers that don't support adding agents directly to a queue, you assign groups of agents to a queue instead of individual agents.

If you don’t see the Omni-Channel component in your app, check with your admin. When you mark your status as available in Omni-Channel, you begin receiving work requests, like phone calls. Work items assigned to you appear in Omni-Channel until you complete, transfer, or decline them. Tip By default, phone calls are taken through the same speakers and microphone your system device uses. To take calls through different audio devices, click the Settings icon on the Omni-Channel component and choose your preferred devices under Input and Output. The devices you choose are set only for your current browser. For example, if you choose a device for Google Chrome, that device isn’t set for Mozilla Firefox. This feature isn’t available in the Apple Safari browser. If you set up a service channel to use the tab-based capacity model, Omni-Channel determines agent capacity based on the open tabs. Each tab is a session for a specific work item. To close the work item and remove it from your Omni-Channel instance, close the tab for that item. The tab-based capacity model releases an agent’s capacity when a work tab is closed. If your work item is reassigned to a queue and another agent picks it up, the work item still shows in your Omni-Channel instance until you close the tab. Tab-based capacity models don’t work with apps that use standard navigation. If you set up a service channel to use the status-based capacity model, Omni-Channel determines agent capacity based on the status of accepted work, rather than the open tabs and sessions. Work remains assigned even if the agent closes the tab. If an agent is unavailable, their work still appears in the Omni-Channel component. Their work remains assigned and reflected in their capacity until the work is completed or reassigned to a different agent. When you set up your app, you can choose whether the Omni-Channel component appears as a sidebar or in the utility bar at the bottom of your screen. These images show an open Omni-Channel component in the sidebar layout. The sidebar layout is recommended, as it provides more screen real estate and is the primary location for future Omni-Channel component features. Regardless of which layout you choose, the Omni-Channel component organizes work items with new work items at the top, in-progress items in the middle, and paused items at the bottom. This image shows the Service Console with the Omni-Channel component opened in the sidebar. This image shows the same Service Console with the Omni-Channel sidebar view collapsed. This image shows new work (1), selected work that’s paused (2), and work with an update notification (3) in an opened sidebar Omni-Channel component. The sidebar and utility-bar versions of the Omni-Channel component have equivalent functionality. When Enhanced Omni-Channel is enabled: The Omni-Channel component uses an inbox format instead of New and My Work tabs, and is a single consolidated list. The currently open work item is highlighted. An icon indicates work that was paused. A blue dot appears in the item’s box to flag work that was updated. To open the Omni-Channel component: For the sidebar layout, click the Omni-Channel sidebar component icon on the left-hand side of the screen. For the utility-bar version, click Omni-Channel in the footer of your screen. Click the dropdown menu and select your status. If you’re online, a green dot is shown next to the status. Now you’re ready to work with customers. To accept an incoming work item, click the checkmark button in the Omni-Channel component. When you accept a work item, the Omni-Channel component shows a timer. The timer shows the duration since the work item was first added to a queue. When you have an incoming work item, the Omni-Channel component lets you know with an audible signal. You can also set up a visual notification so that you don’t miss an important work item when you’re away from its browser window. Turn on settings in the operating system and browser applications so that you can receive notifications. Then in the Omni-Channel component, click the Settings icon and turn on Show new work notifications in the browser . When a new work item is assigned and the browser window isn’t in focus, you receive an alert. To view the browser window and accept or decline the work item, click the alert. Tip To avoid missing work items routed to you, choose a preferred device for receiving notification sounds from Omni-Channel. Click the Settings icon on the Omni-Channel component and choose the device under Ringer Output. The device you choose is only set for your current browser. For example, if you choose a device for Google Chrome, that device isn’t set for Mozilla Firefox. This feature isn’t available in Apple’s Safari browser. See Also Understand Capacity Models "

Case assignment rules can assign cases regardless of how cases are created. Cases can be created manually or automatically using Web-to-Case, Email-to-Case, On-Demand Email-to-Case, the Self-Service portal, the Customer Portal, Outlook, or Lotus Notes. Organizations typically use one rule for each overall purpose. For example, use one lead assignment rule for importing leads and use a different lead assignment rule for web-generated leads. Or use one case assignment rule for standard use and one case assignment rule for holiday use. For each rule type, only one rule can be in effect at any time. Each rule consists of multiple rule entries that specify exactly how the leads or cases are assigned. For example, your standard case assignment rule can have two entries: cases with “Type equals Gold” are assigned to the “Gold Service” queue, and cases with “Type equals Silver” are assigned to the “Silver Service” queue. To create an assignment rule, from Setup, enter Assignment Rules in the Quick Find box, then select Lead Assignment Rules or Case Assignment Rules .

Choose New , and then give the rule a name. Specify whether you want this rule to be the active rule for leads or cases that are created manually and via the web and email. Then click Save . To create the rule entries, click New . For each entry, you can specify: Field Description Order Sets the order in which the entry is processed in the rule, for example, 1, 2, 3 . Salesforce evaluates each entry in order and tries to match the criteria for the entry. When a match is found, Salesforce assigns the item and stops evaluating the rule entries for that item. If no match is found, the item is reassigned to either the default Web-to-Lead owner, the administrator doing a lead import, or the default case owner. Criteria Specifies conditions that the lead or case must match for it to be assigned. Enter your rule criteria. Choose criteria are met and select the filter criteria that a record must meet to trigger the rule. For example, set a case filter to Priority equals High if you want case records with the Priority field marked High to trigger the rule. If your organization uses multiple languages, enter filter values in your organization’s default language. You can add up to 25 filter criteria of up to 255 characters each. When you use picklists to specify filter criteria, the selected values are stored in the organization's default language. If you edit or clone existing filter criteria, first set the Default Language on the Company Information page to the same language that was used to set the original filter criteria. Otherwise, the filter criteria may not be evaluated as expected. Choose formula evaluates to true and enter a formula that returns a value of “True” or “False.” Salesforce triggers the rule if the formula returns “True.” For example, the formula AND(ISCHANGED( Priority ), ISPICKVAL (Priority, ""High"") ) triggers a rule that changes the owner of a case when the Priority field is changed to High. If your condition uses a custom field, the rule entry is deleted automatically if the custom field is deleted. User Specifies the user or queue that the lead or case is assigned to. Users specified here cannot be marked “inactive”, and they must have “Read” permission on leads or cases. Note You can't revoke the “Read” permission on leads or cases for users assigned to a rule. If your organization uses divisions, leads are assigned to the default division of the user or queue specified in this field. Cases inherit the division of the contact to which they are related. If no contact is specified, cases are assigned to the default global division. Do Not Reassign Owner Specifies that the current owner on a lead or case will not be reassigned to the lead or case when it is updated. Email Template Specifies the email template to use for the notification email that is automatically sent to the new owner. If you don’t specify an email template, then Salesforce doesn’t send a notification email. When a lead or case is assigned to a queue, the notification email is sent to the Queue Email address specified for the queue and all queue members. Predefined Case Teams Specifies the predefined case teams to add to a case. A case team is a group of people that work together to solve cases. To select a predefined case team to add to the assignment rule, click the lookup (magnifying glass) icon. To add more predefined case teams, click Add Row to add a row in which you can specify a predefined case team. Replace any existing predefined case teams on the case When a case matches the condition, any existing predefined case teams assigned to the case are replaced with the specified case teams. After creating the entry, click Save , or Save & New to save the entry and create more entries. Tip Create an error-proof rule by always creating the last rule entry with no criteria.

If you want to send notification emails when a case escalates, create email templates. When Salesforce applies an escalation rule to a case, it inspects the case and compares the case to the criteria in the rule entry. If the case matches the criteria defined in the rule entry, Salesforce runs the escalation actions. Orgs typically use one escalation rule that consists of multiple rule entries. For example, your standard case escalation rule could have two entries: cases with Type set to Gold are escalated within two hours, and cases with Type set to Silver are escalated within eight hours. From Setup, enter Escalation Rules in the Quick Find box, then select Escalation Rules . Create the escalation rule. Click New and name the rule.

We store your criteria in a rule entry. Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When Salesforce applies an escalation rule to a case, it inspects the case and compares the case to the criteria in the rule entry. If the case matches the criteria defined in the rule entry, Salesforce runs the escalation actions. Let’s break down the parts of an escalation rule entry and go over the best practices for each step: Step 1: Rule Entry Order The Sort Order determines the sequence in which Salesforce evaluates rule entries [1]. Typically, orgs use one escalation rule that’s made up of several rule entries. Tip As a best practice, put the most complex rule entries at the beginning of the sort order. Put more generic rule entries at the end of the sort order. Suppose that you have five rule entries. Salesforce looks at the first rule entry to see if its criteria matches the case. If the criteria matches, then Salesforce stops evaluating and escalates the case. If the criteria doesn’t match, then Salesforce looks at the second rule entry to see if it matches, and so on, until it finds a match. If the first rule entry is generic, then Salesforce finds a match and escalates the case without continuing to evaluate later rule entries. It’s a good practice to put a generic “catch-all” rule entry at the end of the rule entry order. The catch-all rule entry is designed to escalate cases that don’t meet the criteria specified in the other rule entries. For example, perhaps you want to escalate cases that have been open for more than 48 hours. Create a rule entry that contains no criteria so that it catches all remaining cases, and specify that cases escalate 48 hours after they were created. Step 2: Rule Entry Criteria The rule entry criteria define the case field values that trigger an escalation. When Salesforce evaluates the rule entry, it looks at the criteria and sees if the criteria match the field values set on the case. If the criteria match, the case is escalated. Run this rule if the criteria are met You can define escalation criteria using field values by selecting criteria are met [2.1]. Select the field, select the operator, and select the value [2.2]. For example, suppose that we want to escalate cases that are high priority and from our two biggest customers, Acme and Global Media. We can create a rule entry that escalates cases where the Priority field equals High and the Account: Account Name field equals Acme or Global Media . You can specify more field values by filling out the rows. Tip By default, the filter concatenates the rows using AND. However, if you want to use a different filter operator, click Add Filter Logic [2.3]. You can refine the filter using parentheses, AND, and OR. For example, (1 AND 2) or (3 AND 4). Run this rule if the criteria are met You can define escalation criteria using a formula by selecting formula evaluates to true . Enter a formula that returns a value of True or False. Salesforce triggers the rule if the formula returns “True.” Step 3: Business Hours Criteria Business hours let you specify when your support team is available [3]. If business hours are specified on the escalation rule, then escalation actions occur only during business hours. Let’s look at some examples. Let’s say that your support team is based in San Francisco and works from 9 AM-5 PM Monday-Friday, Pacific time. Ignore business hours If you don’t want to use business hours when calculating when cases are escalated, select Ignore business hours . In this situation, a case is escalated without consideration of the support team’s business hours or the case’s business hours. For example, a case might escalate at 3 AM Pacific time, even though the support team isn’t available. Use business hours specified on the case A case might have different business hours than your support team. If business hours are specified on the case, then the case escalates during the case’s business hours. Suppose that your support team is located in San Francisco and works 9-5 Pacific time, but your customer is located in New York and operates on Eastern time. You could specify Eastern business hours on the case, so that your support team knows to contact the customer during Eastern business hours. If Use business hours specified on the case is selected, then the case escalates during East Coast business hours. So, a case could escalate at 6 AM Pacific, because that’s within Eastern business hours (9 AM -5 PM Eastern, which is 6 AM-2 PM Pacific). Set business hours Use the lookup to select the business hours that are defined for your company. If you select this option, then cases are escalated during these hours. Perhaps you’ve defined business hours as 9 AM-5 PM Pacific time. If you select the 9-5 Pacific time business hours, then cases would only be escalated during that time period. Step 4: How Escalation Times Are Set Specify when the escalation clock starts ticking by specifying how escalation times are set [4]. Your selection here affects when the time period specified in the Age Over field begins to run. You can set the Age Over field on the Escalation Actions page. When case is created The escalation clock starts ticking when the case is created, and the case escalates when the time period set in the Age Over field expires. If Age Over is set to 5 hours, then the case escalates five hours after the case is created. If the case is created at 9 AM on Monday morning, it would escalate at 2 PM on Monday afternoon. When case is created, and disable after case is first modified The escalation clock starts ticking when the case is created but stops when the case is modified, provided that the case is modified before the Age Over time period expires. If Age Over is set to 5 hours, then the case escalates five hours after the case is created unless the case is modified before five hours elapse. If the case is created at 9 AM on Monday morning and isn’t modified within the five-hour period, then the case would escalate at 2 PM on Monday afternoon. However, if the case is created at 9 AM on Monday and a support agent modifies the case at 10 AM, then the case wouldn’t escalate. Based on last modification time The escalation clock starts ticking when the case is modified. If Age Over is set to 5 hours, then the case escalates five hours after the case is last modified. Suppose that the case is created at 9 AM on Monday morning and an agent modifies the case at 10 AM. The case would escalate at 3 PM on Monday afternoon, which is five hours after the 10 AM modification. See Also Set Up Escalation Rules Escalation Actions "

An escalation rule can reassign the case to another support agent (user) or support queue (queue). An escalation rule also can send notification emails to the new assignee, to the current case owner, and to other recipients. Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Let’s break down the parts of an escalation action and go over best practices for each step: Age Over Salesforce escalates the case if the case hasn’t been closed within this time period [1]. For example, escalate the case if it hasn’t been closed within five hours. This time is calculated from the date field set in the Specify how escalation times are set field in the rule entry. No two escalation actions can have the same number in this field. The Age Over field is required, because escalation rules are time-based. Auto-Reassign Cases When a case escalates, Salesforce can reassign the case to a different user or queue [2]. Queue or User —Select a user or queue to reassign the case to. When a case is reassigned, the queue or user becomes the new case owner. Companies typically reassign cases to a queue instead of a specific user. For example, if Level 1 support doesn’t resolve a case within 24 hours, the case is reassigned to the Level 2 support queue. Notification Template —Select a notification template to use to send a notification email to the assignee. If you select a Notification Template , then Salesforce sends a notification email to the new case owner. The template controls which fields are included in the notification email. For example, the email template might include the case number, case contact, account name, and case reason so that the new case owner can quickly understand the situation. Notify Users When a case escalates, Salesforce can send a notification email so that a user, the current case owner, or other email recipients know that the case is escalating [3]. Notify This User —Select a user to notify. For example, you might want to notify the support manager. Notify Case Owner —Send an email to the current case owner to remind them that the case is escalating. Select this checkbox when you want to notify the case owner but haven’t reassigned the case. Additional Emails —You can send notification emails to other people when a case is escalated. Enter up to five email addresses, each on a separate line. For example, you can set up an escalation rule to notify support managers or executives so that they know that a case is escalating. Notification Template —If you select Notify This User, Notify Case Owner , or Additional Emails , then you must select a notification template to send a notification email to the user, case owner, or additional recipients. The template controls which fields are included in the notification email. See Also Set Up Escalation Rules Escalation Rule Entries "

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Service Cloud includes lots of data that you're familiar with, such as cases and accounts. But your customers are generating other data that can provide valuable context to your support team. Customers aren’t just filing cases; they're browsing your website, buying and returning products, giving feedback, and clicking marketing emails. When you integrate Data Cloud with Service Cloud and Field Service, you can access and analyze that additional data in automations and data visualizations. To get the whole picture about your forecast and the pipeline that’s there to fill it, gather and prepare data from these possible sources. Data Type Examples CRM data from Salesforce Accounts Open cases Work orders Service appointments Assets Third-party data Past purchases Products and services Web engagement Billing Systems and assets Network data System performance data Device data Unifying this data means your support team has the information they need to deliver proactive, data-driven customer service. The Salesforce admin works in Setup and Data Cloud Setup to set up your Salesforce org, organize your data streams, and unlock insights that can be leveraged during service interactions. Task 1: Configure Users for Data Cloud To work with external data in Salesforce, make sure that Data Cloud is set up and provisioned in your Salesforce org. Set up a Data Cloud admin user . Assign Data Cloud permission sets . Task 2: Connect Your Data Sources to Data Cloud Data sources are the places that currently hold your data. Those places can be Salesforce for cases and work orders or third-party sources such as Google Storage or Amazon S3 for past purchases or web engagement data. To bring your data together, connect your data sources in Data Cloud. How you connect your data depends on where the data is coming from. Make a list of where this data comes from and who has access and credentials to this data. Install the Service Cloud bundle in Data Cloud Setup. See Salesforce CRM Connector . Configure third-party data sources using a connector service or a pre-built connector or integration in Data Cloud Setup. You can also connect data, but not store it, through partner data sources using the Data Cloud Bring Your Own Lake (BYOL) Data Federation . Task 3: Bring Voice Call and Messaging Transcripts into Data Cloud Get insights from your service team’s voice calls and enhanced messaging sessions by adding your transcript data to Data Cloud. Without this feature, supervisors have limited options for reporting on voice and messaging activity. Enable transcripts in Data Cloud . In Data Cloud Setup, view two new data streams that were created: one for conversation entries and one for related records, each with a data connector type of Conversation Storage. The data streams are mapped to the Conversation Entry and Engagement Topic data model objects, respectively. After transcripts are enabled in Data Cloud, you can create Conversation Entry reports in Data Cloud, perform SOQL queries, and send API requests to the Data Cloud endpoint. Task 4: Map Your Data Now that your data sources are connected, create data streams to bring the data into Salesforce. Your data is brought in as is, which means fields and their data types are imported without transformation. Next, this data must be mapped to the data model objects (DMOs) in Data Cloud. Create a data stream for your Salesforce CRM using a starter data bundle, which includes accounts, cases, and work orders. The data stream comes with pre-mapped fields for standard Salesforce objects. Create a data stream and for each of the external data sources. See Data Sources in Data Cloud to find all the connection steps for your data sources. For external sources and custom objects, you need to map your data to DMOs. Map all fields that are required for your business use cases and to complete identity resolution. See Data Modeling Requirements for Identity Resolution and Data Mapping . Task 5: Unify Your Data into Profiles Use an identity resolution ruleset to link multiple sources of data into one profile. A ruleset contains match and reconciliation rules based on the Account data model object or the Individual data model object. Create an identity resolution ruleset . Add match rules . Set a default reconciliation rule . Run the ruleset and then view unified profile results in Profile Explorer . See Unify Source Profiles . Task 6: Set Up Foundational Service Dashboards Get pre-built dashboards to track KPIs and trends related to cases, Knowledge, Omni-Channel routing, and other service features. Surface data from these dashboards, such as the Customer Effort Score, in the Service Console to guide agents during service interactions. While you can build your own apps in Data Cloud without Service Intelligence, it's nice to have someone else do the visualization work for you. For steps, see Service Intelligence Setup . What's Next Now that you’ve connected your data, you can bring the power of that data across Salesforce. Here are a few suggested next steps. Enrich Service Cloud records with insights. After establishing a calculated insight or other supported Data Cloud object, you can use it across Salesforce. Give your support team access to that great data by adding it to a custom field on account, contact, or case records. Take advantage of pre-built Field Service dashboards. Monitor key contact center performance metrics with dashboards focused on assets, work orders, and service appointments. For example, understand and monitor service appointment volume across your organization by territory, status, work type, account, priority, and other attributes. For steps, see Field Service Intelligence Setup . Monitor asset health to proactively address issues. Move from reactive, break-fix service to proactive field service with pre-built Asset Health Score dashboards and related Calculated Insights (CIs). Einstein draws on asset data and repair history to calculate an Asset Health Score and trigger an action for each asset, such as scheduling a proactive service appointment. For example, if a service outage causes a spike in cases impacting a subset of customers, trigger a flow that creates an incident and notifies all impacted customers. For steps, see Proactive Asset Service Setup . "

Available in: Lightning Experience Messaging for In-App and Web, Enhanced Messaging, and Service Cloud Voice are available in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions Transcripts in Standard Versus Enhanced Channels The way that you access Messaging and Voice transcripts varies depending on the type of channel. This variation lets Salesforce provide conversation data at the scale and speed required at the enterprise level. Each method comes with its own considerations, so the method you use depends on your situation. In standard SMS, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger channels, a ConversationEntry record is created for each message sent by a messaging end user or an agent, bot, or automation. Each ConversationEntry record is associated with a MessagingSession record, which represents the interaction between the messaging end user and the business. Access and work with ConversationEntry records like any standard object. You can report on messaging activity and track the conversation workflow end to end. You can also download or delete transcripts, redact sensitive text, and customize your workflows with solutions built on the ConversationEntry object. In enhanced Messaging channels, Messaging for In-App and Web, and Service Cloud Voice (""enhanced channels""), inbound and outbound messages are processed in one of two ways depending on your location. A ConversationEntry record is created but the Message field is blank, or No ConversationEntry record is created. To get the fullest picture of conversations in enhanced channels, use Data Cloud, the Connect REST API, or the Conversation Transcript Export tool to access transcripts. Let’s review the actions that you can take in each type of channel. Action Supported in Standard Messaging? Supported in Enhanced Messaging, Messaging for In-App and Web, and Service Cloud Voice?* View transcripts Yes. View them in the Conversation component in the Service Console, or view individual ConversationEntry records. Yes. View them in Data Cloud or in the Enhanced Conversation component in the Service Console. Search transcripts No. No. Report on transcripts Yes. Create custom report types with ConversationEntry as the primary object. For example, create a report showing all messaging sessions conducted per month, organized by status. Yes. Analyze transcripts in Data Cloud with reports and dashboards or Tableau. Download transcripts Yes. Use Data Loader or the Salesforce Bulk and REST APIs. Or, use the Conversation Transcript Export tool to download your entire transcript history weekly. Yes. Use the Conversation Transcript Export tool to download your entire transcript history weekly. Delete transcripts to protect customer data Yes. Deleting a customer’s messaging sessions and messaging user records deletes all associated ConversationEntry records. Yes. See: Delete Voice Call Customer Data Delete Messaging Customer Data Redact text in transcripts Yes. Create sensitive data rules in Setup to mask certain patterns of text, or use the Salesforce SOAP API. Yes. Use the Connect REST API to update voice call or messaging transcripts. See Upload or Update Transcripts with Connect REST API . Use the Salesforce API to work with conversation data Yes. Yes. Analyze your data by using the Data Cloud API. * Includes Bring Your Own Channel in Messaging. Note ConversationEntry records aren’t created until the messaging session ends and the agent closes the session tab. One exception is for the first message in any standard messaging session, whose ConversationEntry record is created immediately. Considerations for Accessing Transcripts via the Connect REST API The Connect REST API has a different rate limit than other Salesforce APIs, which can affect the way you work with conversation data. Because there's no bulk API for accessing messaging sessions or voice call records, multiple API calls may be required to fetch all entries in a conversation. Transcripts returned via the Connect REST API are text-only, so they don’t include rich content or bot messages. Voice call entries aren’t tied to the voice call record until the call ends. Note In enhanced Messaging channels, you can also use Lightning web components to monitor agent and customer messages in real time. See Lightning Web Component Events for Enhanced Messaging . Analyze Conversation Transcript Data in Data Cloud Use Data Cloud to access transcripts from enhanced Messaging channels, voice calls, and Unified Messaging to review and analyze conversation data. Analyze transcripts with reports and dashboards in Data Cloud, zoom in to your data with Data Cloud API, and search for specific information by using Salesforce Object Query Language (SOQL) queries. Export Conversation Transcripts Salesforce admins can export conversation transcripts for Voice, Messaging for In-App and Web, enhanced Facebook Messenger, and enhanced WhatsApp in any production org. Conversation export isn’t supported in sandboxes. Block Sensitive Data in Messaging Sessions and Voice Call Transcripts Create sensitive data rules to block specific patterns, such as credit card numbers or profanity, in standard and enhanced Messaging sessions, Messaging for In-App and Web, and voice call transcripts. You can remove the text or replace it with your preferred characters. This method, also known as data masking, helps protect your customers’ data.

They don’t apply to whispered messages, messaging components, text in attached files, the agent name, or any other standard text that’s visible in the messaging window. In Setup, enter Sensitive Data in the Quick Find box. To create rules for standard Messaging channels, select the page named Sensitive Data Rules for Standard Channels . To create rules for enhanced Messaging channels, Messaging for In-App and Web, and Voice transcripts, select the page named Sensitive Data Rules for Enhanced Channels . Click New or New Sensitive Data Rule . Enter a name and description, and select Active to start enforcing your rule when you save it. Enter the text pattern or patterns that you want to hide. Write each pattern as a JavaScript regular expression (regex), and choose your preferred settings. The regex is case-sensitive. Select whether to remove or replace the text pattern when it’s detected. If you choose to replace it, enter your replacement text. Expand the preview section to test your rule. Enter text in the format of the data you want to hide, such as 123-45-6789 for a Social Security number. Verify that the text is removed or replaced in the preview. Move one or more roles to the selected column to enforce the rule on messages sent or words spoken by that role. For example, to hide data with these patterns in messages sent by customers, move Visitors to the Selected Roles column. Assign a priority to the rule, such as 0 or 1. Rules with lower numbers are enforced first. Save your rule. (Enhanced channels only) When you’re ready to start enforcing your active rules, turn on the Sensitive Data Rules setting at the top of the page. When this setting is on, all active data rules shown on the Sensitive Data Rules for Enhanced Messaging page are enforced. When this setting is off, they aren’t enforced, but you can still create and activate rules on that page. This setting doesn’t apply to rules for standard channels, and isn’t visible on the Sensitive Data Rules for Standard Channels page. When sensitive data is detected in a messaging session or voice transcript, one or more of these conversation transcript events is logged: Sensitive data blocked (Agent) Sensitive data blocked (Supervisor) Sensitive data blocked (Visitor) Rules are enforced in real time, and sensitive text is hidden both for agents and in the transcripts stored in the database. If you create or update a sensitive data rule for standard channels, your changes take effect within 60 seconds. If you create or update a sensitive data rule for enhanced channels, Messaging for In-App and Web, and Voice, your changes take effect within 1 hour. Sensitive data isn’t redacted in Voice recordings; only in transcripts. Note After a rule for enhanced channels is activated, it’s automatically enforced on the selected roles in all future voice calls, enhanced messaging sessions, and Messaging for In-App and Web sessions. It’s not possible to enforce it selectively—for example, to enforce it for Voice but not Messaging for In-App and Web. You can have up to 10 active sensitive data rules at a time for enhanced channels. "

Scheduling tools—get candidates, batch assign, and mass shift update—help them find the right agents for shifts based on scheduling rules, constraints, and objectives that you define. Workforce Engagement is available in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Shift Scheduling is available in the Contact Center Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Einstein 1 Service Edition, and Service Suites To get started, your planners create shifts for the coverage required in your contact centers. They view upcoming shifts in the Shift Manager scheduler view by job profile or assigned service resource, and match agents to shifts with the scheduling tools. To narrow the list of shift candidates, the scheduler first applies scheduling rules. To be considered for a shift, a service resource must pass all the defined rules. The Match Territory rule identifies service resources whose operating hours and service territory are aligned with the shift’s time range and service territory. A Match Skills rule finds service resources with all skills that are listed on the shift’s job profile. An Availability rule finds candidates who are available to work the shift. It eliminates service resources who are assigned to other shifts during the same time or who have a planned absence. It also filters out candidates whose operating hours in their primary or secondary territory don’t cover the shift’s hours. (Workforce Engagement only) If you’re using an Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow, the Match Queue rule identifies agents who are members of the right queues. When you set up scheduling in Workforce Engagement, you create job profile-to-queue mappings. The scheduler looks at the shift’s job profile, finds the associated queues, and considers only those agents who are members of those queues. From the pool of candidates defined by rules, the scheduler then considers rules that limit how many shifts or hours a resource can work. For example, you can define a Work Limit rule that restricts part-time employees to a maximum of 25 hours per week. A Limit Non-Standard Shifts rule can restrict weekend shifts per month. A Rest Time in Minutes rule makes sure that agents get some downtime between shift assignments. You can also define scheduling objectives that reflect your business goals. For example, to distribute assignments evenly among agents, add Balance Shifts and Balance Non-Standard Shifts objectives. To consider agents’ preferences for when they want to work, create a Maximized Preferences objective. Using objectives, the scheduler scores candidates to indicate how well they match the proposed shift. For example, if the rules narrow the candidate pool of 100 agents to 10 agents, scheduling scores the remaining 10 candidates using the Balance Shift objective. If Agents 1 and 2 don’t have many shifts assigned during the objective’s time frame, they’re given a higher grade. Agents 3 through 10 have many shifts during that period, so they’re given a lower grade and less likely to be assigned to the shift. When you define multiple objectives, grades for each objective are weighted equally. For instance, if you have three objectives, each grade is weighted as 33%. The total of the agent’s three grades is the agent’s final score. When you hover over a shift and use get candidates, the grade appears as a percentage. Batch assignment and mass shift update assign the candidate that’s the best match based on agent scores. Shift Scheduling Considerations and Limits Review considerations and limits for the shift scheduling tools. Preparing for Shift Scheduling Before your planners can create shifts and assign them, configure Salesforce for shift scheduling. Create Shifts Create shifts for particular dates and times when you need coverage and then assign those shifts to agents. Shift Segments Shift segments show team leads and agents a granular breakdown of activities assigned during a shift. Shift Scheduling Tools The scheduling tools—get candidates, batch assign, and mass shift update—help planners assign the right agents where and when they’re needed. Managing and Viewing Shift Schedules View upcoming shifts as a planner or an agent. Planners can switch to the schedule view to see weekly shifts grouped by service territory or job profile in a calendar. Service Resource Preferences Show agents that you care about their well-being, both in and outside of work. Service Resource Preferences allow agents to specify daily operating hours that they prefer to work. These preferences are considered when a team lead assigns shifts using the scheduling tools. Time Sheets and Time-Off Requests Gain oversight into agents’ time sheets and time-off requests. Approve or deny submissions from an individual agent’s service resource profile or from the Time Sheets or Resource Absences tabs. "

Workforce Engagement is available in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Shift Scheduling is available in the Contact Center Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Einstein 1 Service Edition, and Service Suites Shift scheduling tools are available with a Shift Scheduling or Workforce Engagement license. Depending on which license you have, keep these considerations and differences in mind. For Shift Scheduling, assign the Shift Scheduling Planner and Shift Scheduling Agent permission set licenses. For Workforce Engagement, assign the Workforce Engagement Analyst, Workforce Engagement Planner, and Workforce Engagement Agent permission set licenses. To map job profiles to Omni-Channel queues, Workforce Engagement planners use the Workforce Engagement Configuration app in Setup. The Match Queue scheduling rule is available only in Workforce Engagement with an Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow. If you’re using Shift Scheduling or you’re using a workflow other than Omni-Channel queue-based routing, create a Match Skills scheduling rule to find the right types of agents for your shifts. In Workforce Engagement, you can create a capacity plan based on historical workloads. You can then use shift templates and create shifts in bulk from a capacity plan. Shift Scheduling doesn’t include capacity planning. A planner can define shift segment types in Shift Scheduling and Workforce Engagement. In Shift Scheduling, the adherence threshold and background color fields don’t apply. How agents view shift assignments and shift segments depends on whether you’re using Shift Scheduling or Workforce Engagement. In Shift Scheduling, an agent sees assigned shifts when they open the Shifts related list on their Service Resource record. Agents can view shift segments in a related list on the shift. Access requires the Shift Scheduling Agent permission set. In Workforce Engagement, agents can view shifts with defined shift segments in Agent Home. Only published shifts are visible. Admins must set up Agent Home and assign agents the Workforce Engagement Agent permission set. In Workforce Engagement, shift segments also pair with Intraday Management to monitor under- or overstaffing, make real-time adherence updates, and send email notifications to agents when their schedule changes. To update shift segments, planners can open a Shift record and modify segments. To update shift segments in Workforce Engagement, they can also use the Intraday Management dashboard.

Workforce Engagement is available in Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Shift Scheduling is available in the Contact Center Stock Keeping Unit (SKU), Einstein 1 Service Edition, and Service Suites Example Note Workforce Engagement is scheduled for retirement. See Workforce Engagement Retirement . If you set up Workforce Engagement to create a capacity plan, you completed some steps already. If you completed a step, skip it and proceed to the next one. The steps differ depending on whether you’re using an Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow. A queue-based workflow uses Omni-Channel queues and job profiles to match work assignments to agents. If you’re using a non-Omni workflow, scheduling matches assignments to agents based on their skills. Configuration Step Documentation Step 1. Assign the appropriate permission sets to your users. Assign the Shift Scheduling Planner or Workforce Engagement Planner permission set to users who create and schedule shifts. Assign the Shift Scheduling Agent or Workforce Engagement Agent permission set to your agents. Manage Permission Set Assignments Workforce Engagement User Permission Sets Step 2. In the profile for the user who creates and assigns shifts, set standard object permissions for Service Resource Preferences to View All. It's not possible to edit standard object permissions on a standard user profile, so this user must have a custom profile. Edit Object Permissions in Profiles Step 3. Add related lists to objects. Add the Time Slots related list to the Operating Hours object. Add the Skill Requirements related list to the Job Profiles object. Add the Service Territory, Shifts, Skills, Preferences, Absences, and Time Sheets related lists to the page layout for the Service Resources object. If you’re using Shift Scheduling or a workflow other than Omni-Channel queue-based routing in Workforce Engagement, add the Skill Requirements related list to the Job Profile object. Add a Related List to an Object Step 4. Create operating hours with time slots to represent your business operating hours. Create Operating Hours with Time Slots Step 5. Create service territories for the contact centers where your agents work. Select the operating hours for each service territory. Create a Service Territory Step 6. Create a service resource for each agent that you want to assign shifts to. In the Type field, select Agent. To specify where an agent works, add a service territory to the Service Territory related list on the service resource. Create Service Resources for Agents Step 7. If you’re using Shift Scheduling or a workflow other than Omni-Channel queue-based routing in Workforce Engagement, create skills so that scheduling can match agents’ abilities with work assignments. Add one or more skills to the Skills related list on each service resource. Create and Assign Skills Step 8. Create job profiles to associate with your shifts. If you’re using Shift Scheduling or a workflow other than Omni-Channel queue-based routing in Workforce Engagement, add one or more skills to each job profile. Scheduling then matches shifts with skill requirements in a job profile to agents who have those skills. If you’re using an Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow in Workforce Engagement, scheduling uses job profile to queue mappings instead. Configure these mappings in the next step. Create a Job Profile Step 9. (Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow in Workforce Engagement) If you haven’t done so already, enable Omni-Channel, set up queues, and associate routing configurations with each queue. Add your agent users as queue members. Enable the configuration app in Setup, and map job profiles to queues. Scheduling matches shifts for each job profile to queues with the same job profile. It then assigns the shift to a queue member. Enable Omni-Channel Create Omni-Channel Queues Enable Workforce Engagement and Feature Preferences Map Job Profiles to Queues Step 10. Create scheduling rules that help to match agents to shifts. Create a Match Territory rule. A rule of this type is required. If you’re using Shift Scheduling or a workflow other than Omni-Channel queue-based routing in Workforce Engagement, you want scheduling to assign work based on skills. Create a Match Skills rule. If you’re using a queue-based workflow in Workforce Engagement, you want scheduling to match queues to shifts’ job profiles. Create a Match Queue rule. Optionally, add more rules to narrow down the pool of candidates for each shift. Create a Scheduling Rule Step 11. Create scheduling constraints, such as work limits, to associate with scheduling rules. Add scheduling constraints to service resources or service territories. A scheduling rule looks first for a constraint on a service resource. If there isn’t one, it looks for a constraint on the service territory. Create a Scheduling Constraint Step 12. Create scheduling objectives to reflect business goals. For example, balance shifts across your agents or consider an agent’s shift preference. Create a Scheduling Objective Step 13. Let agents see assigned shifts. Create an Apex trigger that allows agents to see the shifts that have been assigned to them. Allow Agents to See Their Assigned Shifts with an Apex Trigger "

Example Note Workforce Engagement is scheduled for retirement. See Workforce Engagement Retirement . Scheduling Rule Types Type Description Availability Checks if the service resource is available to be assigned to a shift. An Availability rule checks that there are no other shifts assigned at the same time. In addition, you can select whether an Availability rule: Considers agents’ absences Considers agents’ working hours. Service territory membership—the operating hours that agents are available to work in their primary or secondary service territories—determines working hours. Limit Non-Standard Shifts Checks if the service resource has reached the limit for non-standard shifts . Specify the limit in a scheduling constraint on each service resource or service territory. Match Skills Checks if the service resource has the appropriate skills to be assigned to the shift. Skill levels aren’t considered. The scheduling logic looks at the skill related list on the service resource and compares it to the skill requirements specified in the shift's job profile. If you want to schedule using skill levels, create a separate skill for each level. For example, define skills named Claims Level 1, Claims Level 2, and Claims Level 3. Assign these skills to different job profiles and add the right skills to your agents. For example, assign all three skills to a Level 3 agent. Scheduling then considers a Level 3 agent for shifts that have a job profile that requires a Level 1, 2, or 3 skill. Match Queues (Workforce Engagement only) Checks if the agent in the service resource record is a member of all queues that are mapped to the shift's job profile. Before you can create an Omni-Channel plan, map each job profile to the queues that route work assignments . Match Territory Required: Checks if the service resource belongs to the shift’s territory. The scheduling logic considers the dates and time of service territory membership. It also considers the primary and secondary types of territory membership, but doesn't consider the relocation type. Rest Time in Minutes Checks if the service resource has a minimum rest time between consecutive shifts. Define a scheduling constraint with the rest time in minutes and assign it to the appropriate service resources or service territories. Work Limit Checks if the service resource can handle the work unit maximum. You decide if the work unit max is measured in hours or shifts. You choose a specific scheduling constraint to define the type of work required. And you decide if the max is per day, week, or month. You can create custom scheduling constraints.

After you create active shift templates and shift patterns, in the shift manager, click New from Pattern to quickly create multiple shifts for the upcoming weeks. If you specify a service resource who isn’t available in the pattern, the shift is still created and assigned. For example, if an agent has a scheduled Resource Absence, the shift is still created and assigned to that resource. Here’s how to create a shift manually. Open Shifts in the App Launcher. Select a list view from the dropdown menu. Because the All Shifts list view can contain many shifts, we recommend that you create a custom list view. For example, create a list view that filters shifts by service territory or other criteria. Change to the schedule view. Hover over the calendar in the column for the date you want this shift to occur on, and click + New Shift . Select a start and end time for the shift. A second set of times shows the shift’s start and end in the service territory's time zone. Select a shift status. You can specify custom shift status values, or use these defaults. Tentative—The shift is tentatively defined. It can be assigned to a service resource or unassigned. Published—The shift is assigned to a service resource and published. In Workforce Engagement, the agent can view it in Agent Home. In Shift Scheduling, the agent can see the shift schedule with the user permission View Shift Scheduling Results. Confirmed—The shift assignment is confirmed. Optionally, fill in the rest of the fields. Add the service territory and job profile. The service territory indicates where the work takes place.

See Workforce Engagement Retirement . Important You can create shifts from capacity plans only in Workforce Engagement. Shift Scheduling doesn’t include capacity planning. When you create a capacity plan, we analyze your forecast and develop a plan based on the shift templates that you defined. We update plan status when our calculations are completed. On a short-term capacity plan, you can click Create Shifts to add the remaining shifts that you need directly from the plan. When you click Create Shifts on a short-term plan, we consider existing shifts and shift templates and only create the shift deficit: the Required - Available shifts. For example, if 100 shifts are required and 10 shifts exist for the same service territory, job profile, and date range, the process creates 90 shifts. Make sure that your shift templates meet these requirements. Shift templates must have a duration of at least 1 hour. Start and end times must start and end on a quarter hour. For example, 10:00, 10:15, 10:30, and 10:45 are valid times. If you change shift templates after a plan is created, Workforce Engagement can’t create shifts from it. Specifically, if a template’s start time, end time, or job profile changes, you can’t create shifts. From the App Launcher, open Capacity Plans . To open a plan, click its name. After we complete shift calculations on a short-term plan, Create Shifts appears on the capacity plan record home. The button remains visible depending on the shift creation process and plan status. Process Status Shift Creation Status Create Shifts Visible? User Action Ready Ready Yes Users can create shifts for the capacity plan. Running In Progress No Users can wait until the process state and shift creation status change. To get the latest state and status, refresh the page. Failed Failed Yes Users can retry by clicking Create Shifts again. Check that the shift template is still active, and that its start and end times and associated job profile didn't change after the plan was created. Revert any changes and try creating shifts again. If you can’t revert the changes, create another plan and create shifts from it. Finished Successfully Completed No The selected plan already has shifts. To create shifts based on your short-term capacity plan, click Create Shifts . Click Create to confirm. Shift creation status changes from Ready to In Progress and Create Shifts disappears. Note It can take some time for shift creation to finish. Refresh the page periodically for an updated status. If the shift creation process fails, creation status changes to Failed and Create Shifts reappears. You can try again to create shifts. When the process finishes successfully, shift creation status changes to Completed. Create Shifts disappears because all required shifts for the plan have been created. After you create shifts from your short-term plan, you can assign or view them from the Shift Manager scheduler view. "

See Workforce Engagement Retirement . Planners or team leads can edit shift segments before or during a shift in response to fluctuating service demands. Agents can view their assigned shift segments in Agent Home in Workforce Engagement or on the Shift record in a related list. In Workforce Engagement, shift segments work hand-in-hand with Intraday Management to monitor under- or overstaffing, make real-time adherence updates, and notify agents when their schedule is changed. Important Agent Home and Intraday Management are available only in Workforce Engagement. Each shift segment represents an activity, such as phone calling, a meeting, or break, with a start and end time during an agent’s shift. Each shift segment represents a specific type of work (chat, email, or phone call); non-work activity (meeting or training); or break (break or lunch). Create shift segments in 5-minute increments and add them to shifts. How Agents Use Shift Segments Agents can begin their shift and check segments to see the breakdown of their workday. In Workforce Engagement, agents can see shifts and shift segments in Agent Home. With Shift Scheduling, agents can open their Service Resource record, click an assigned shift, and view the Shift Segments related list. How Team Leads Use Shift Segments A team lead’s experience with shift segments depends on whether you’re using Intraday Management in Workforce Engagement or using Shift Scheduling. Functionality With Shift Scheduling or Without Intraday Management With Intraday Management Assign shifts and shift segments to agents on the Shifts tab. X X Update shift segments on the Shifts tab. X X View staffing levels for the current business day in the Intraday Management dashboard, and adjust shift segments in response to fluctuating demands. X View if an agent is out of adherence with a shift segment in the Intraday Management Dashboard when using an Omni-Channel queue-based routing workflow, and adjust the shift segment in response. X Planners who use Shift Scheduling or who aren’t using Intraday Management in Workforce Engagement can review and edit shift segments only in a shift’s related list. Team Management View in Intraday Management Team leads who use Intraday Management in Workforce Engagement can review and edit shift segments in the Team Management View. By combining shift segments with Intraday Management, you can notify agents about assignment changes, and they can notify team leads when they’re out of adherence. Functionality Without Intraday Management With Intraday Management View assigned shifts and shift segments in Agent Home. X X Approve or reject shift segment assignments in Agent Home if the admin has applied an approval process and flow. X X Receive an email when a shift or shift segment is assigned to them or changed. X Trigger an out-of-adherence flag to the team lead when using the Omni-Channel widget to set a service presence status. If the status in the widget differs from the service presence status of the agent’s assigned shift segment past a time threshold, the agent is flagged as out of adherence. X If your admin has set up an approval process and flow in Workforce Engagement, an agent can click a pending shift in Agent Home to approve or reject it. The Approval History page provides both options. Preparing to Use Shift Segments Set up Salesforce to use shift segments in Shift Scheduling or Workforce Engagement.

See Workforce Engagement Retirement . Make sure that you’ve completed the configuration steps in the Preparing for Shift Scheduling . Then consider these possibilities when an agent isn’t assigned to a shift as you expect. Verify that the agent user has an associated service resource of type Agent. Agent users must be active and require the Workforce Engagement Agent permission set. Check the service territory associated with the shift. The Match Territory rule considers only those agents who’s service territory membership matches the shift’s service territory. Review Service Territory Member records in the related list on the service territory or the service resource. When you assign service resources to one or more service territories, we create these Service Territory Member records. The records represent service resources who are available to work in that territory and when. If the record doesn’t reference operating hours, scheduling uses the service territory’s operating hours to define when an agent is available to work. (Workforce Engagement only) If you’ve defined a Match Queue rule, verify that the agent user for the service resource is a member of all queues mapped to the shift’s job profile. When you set up scheduling, you map each job profile to one or more queues. Scheduling looks at the shift’s job profile and finds agent users who are members of all queues that are mapped to the job profile. If you’ve defined a Match Skill rule, check that the service resource has all the same skills as the skill requirements on the shift’s job profile. Check that end dates on skills haven’t yet occurred. Scheduling doesn’t consider skill levels. If you want to schedule using skill levels, create a separate skill for each level. Check if you have an Availability rule. An Availability rule eliminates candidates who have other shift assignments, who are absent, or whose operating hours in their primary or secondary territories don’t cover the shift hours. If a service resource isn’t a candidate as you’d expect, verify that the agent doesn’t have other assigned shifts or absences at the time of the shift. Also review the operating hours, service territory, and service territory membership configurations. Each service resource requires a primary service territory membership. Check if the service territory membership covers the entire duration of the shift. If an agent has operating hours that differ from your center’s hours, define operating hours on their service resource record. Operating hours on a service territory membership override what’s defined on the service territory. Check that the shift duration is fully within the operating hours on the service territory or service territory membership. Make sure that time zone translations align. To troubleshoot, widen the resource’s operating hours temporarily. If you’ve defined a Work Limit or Limit Non-Standard Shifts scheduling rule, check that all service resource or service territory records have a valid scheduling constraint. A value of zero can cause unreliable results. If a constraint doesn’t apply, set the limit as null or to an unreachable number. A constraint on a service resource overrides what’s defined on a service territory. "

Because the All Shifts list view can have a huge number of shifts, we recommend that you create a custom list view. For example, create a list view that filters by service territory and other criteria. Click the dropdown menu next to the list view name, and select the list view that contains the shifts that you want to see. To show shifts in the schedule view, click and select . To see a weekly calendar of shifts assigned to each job profile, click the Shifts tab. To see a weekly calendar of shifts assigned to each service resource, click the Resources tab. The schedule view shows your shifts. A red pain icon indicates that the shift is non-standard. You can use colors to identify or highlight shifts. A horizontal color stripe on each shift also indicates shift status. You can't customize the status color-coding. The status colors are: Tentative—orange Published—blue Confirmed—green Keep these considerations in mind when you work with shifts. When you use get candidates, batch assignment, or mass shift update, the scheduling logic uses the time zone of the service territory. In the schedule view, to see shift assignments in the time zone of the resource, turn on Territory Time Zone . Turn it off to see the schedule in your time zone. On the Shifts tab, you can’t use the quick search box to filter. When you create custom list views, you can define logical expressions that filter your shifts; for example, 1 AND 2 where 1 is Service Territory equals New York and 2 is Job Profile equals Financial Advisor . The NOT operator isn’t supported when you define filter logic for shifts. If your filter logic uses NOT, we recommend adjusting the filter type instead, for example by using the does not contain operator. You can create a shift from the schedule view by hovering in an empty space and clicking + New Shift . View Your Shift Schedule How agents view shift assignments depends on whether they’re using Shift Scheduling or Workforce Engagement. Required User Permissions User Permissions Needed To view a shift assignment: Shift Scheduling Agent OR Workforce Engagement Agent In Workforce Engagement, agents can see their shift assignments in Agent Home.

Each time the status or owner changes, the counter begins again at zero. Cases in Portals If you have enabled the Self-Service portal, you can run reports to track usage of your Self-Service portal. When reporting on case comments, use the Public Case Commented field to indicate if the comment is private or public. Public comments are indicated with a check mark. To limit report results to public comments, customize the report and add a field filter where Public Case Commented equals True . Likewise, the filter Public Case Commented equals 0 yields only private case comments. Choose the Closed by Self-Service User field to report on how many cases have been closed by users via suggested solutions on the Self-Service portal. Solution Categories Create a custom report that sorts solutions by category. Select the Category Name field to display the solution’s category and the Parent Category Name field to display the category directly above the solution’s category. If you restrict your report to solutions in a particular category, the report includes only solutions that are directly associated with that category. It does not include solutions in subcategories of the specified category. To report on uncategorized solutions, use the advanced report filters. Choose the Category Name field and the “equals” operator, and leave the third field blank. Team Members You can report on case teams in which you are a member. After you run a case report, select My case team's cases from the Show drop-down. Owner Role for case reports is defined differently than for other objects. For most objects, Owner Role is defined in the Role Name as displayed on reports field on the user’s role. Cases uses the Label field instead.

Learn five principles that you can follow to deliver ethical customer service with Salesforce. Center Human Experiences For agents, this means focusing on contact center technology use cases that help them find, generate, and capture information, but that don’t get in the way of what the agents do best: creating positive customer interactions. For customers, it means understanding that many of them still seek human interactions, so don’t force them through challenging bot flows without an easy way to reach a live human. For example, let your best agents stress-test your automation and self-service flows: they know better than anyone what’s likely to break or succeed! Build Trust with Transparency Give supervisors the right tools to monitor and measure productivity, without robbing agents of flexibility and autonomy. Be clear about when agents are being tracked, and why. Clearly communicate when customers are interacting with a bot, and be explicit about interactions—whether with bot or human—that are being recorded. This means never leading customers to believe they’re chatting with a human if they’re really chatting with a bot. On the agent side, if you’re monitoring an interaction, provide feedback about the call shortly after it ends to show agents the value of monitoring. Evolve KPIs to Fit the Moment Avoid over-reliance on metrics that may not be appropriate for a remote setting or don't tell the complete story of an interaction. Routinely evaluate what you measure and why. Build new metrics that include agent perspectives and help them grow their proficiency and product expertise. For example, consider measuring the impact of a positive agent interaction on customer lifetime value (CLV) and loyalty. And, recognize that as automation increases, the calls making it to an agent are likely to be more complicated, so consider reducing reliance on average handle time (AHT). Train Intentionally Develop a training program that considers the difficulty of virtual learning and the loss of side-by-side shadowing. Find ways to give new remote agents confidence to handle difficult situations. Use workforce management tools to provide upskilling opportunities and positive feedback throughout a shift. If you’re already using call monitoring, for example, you might use the same tool to help junior agents virtually shadow more senior ones. Likewise, use badging and certifications to help agents upskill, and make sure you intentionally carve out time for them to complete bite-sized training modules. Protect Personal Data at the Source Implement training and technical guardrails to protect sensitive personal information collected in service interactions. Use data classification to limit how personal data gathered in a service context is used for other purposes, like marketing. Regularly remind remote agents to protect data by securing their devices. Limit access to data—including employee data—to only those who need it, and if your organization uses video chat or visual monitoring, be sure remote agents don’t leave sensitive personal information visible. Finally, honor customers’ requests to delete their data.
