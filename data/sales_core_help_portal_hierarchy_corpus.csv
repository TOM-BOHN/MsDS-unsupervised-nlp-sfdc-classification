Available in: all editions Salesforce Campaigns + Account Engagement Socks Unlimited supplies socks to a variety of retailers in the United States. The company wants to nurture prospects that they met at a recent trade show in Boston. Marketing manager Priya wants to use Engagement Studio to automate the process. Before Priya builds her engagement program, she creates a Salesforce campaign called Trade Shows. She uses this campaign as a parent campaign and creates child campaigns to track events including NE Trade Show 2021. In Account Engagement, she builds an engagement program that sends a series of emails, forms, and event invitations. When Engagement Studio sends an email, the prospect is added as a campaign member to NE Trade Show 2021 with a Sent status. Other actions update the custom campaign member status each time the prospect interacts with another asset. Another action scores prospects as they move through the program. When a prospect’s score is good enough to be considered marketing qualified, the prospect is assigned to a Socks Unlimited sales rep. Then, tracking continues into the sales funnel. When it comes time to report her progress, Priya can use Engagement Studio reporting together with Salesforce campaign reports to identify where the trade show prospects are responding best. The rollup metrics in the hierarchy that she created can also tell her whether the Boston trade show yielded more engagement than other events that her team attended. Salesforce Campaigns and Marketing Cloud Engagement Floor manager Don just learned that his car dealership is finally getting more inventory of the newest hatchback that people come in asking about. He wants to set up his sales reps for success. They need high-quality, branded content so that they can follow up with folks who expressed interest. He calls Liliana in corporate marketing and finds out that she’s already a step ahead. A while back, Liliana used Distributed Marketing tools to create a personalized customer journey in Marketing Cloud Engagement and connected it to a Sales Cloud campaign. She gives Don the name of the campaign, which he can share with his reps. Now anyone with access to the Sales Cloud campaign can add a campaign member and customize the email content from Liliana’s marketing journey. Don’s potential customers get great looking content from his sales reps, and Liliana can track the journey metrics and campaign performance from corporate.

For example, statuses for an event can include Invited, Registered, and Attended. Do you want to include Declined or No Show? For consistency, we recommend that you create a single set of campaign member statuses for each type of campaign that you run. Document the statuses for internal use. To allow users to create their own campaign member statuses, an admin adds the Campaign Member Statuses related list to campaign records. Using the Campaign Member Status Field From a campaign’s Campaign Member Statuses related list, users can create a status, select a default status, and indicate whether the status is considered a response. Salesforce tallies response records together in the Responses in Campaign field. When someone interacts with your campaign, their member status doesn’t change automatically. After you create campaign member statuses, you can apply a status to campaign member records manually, in bulk, or with Account Engagement automation tools. You can use the Campaign Member Status field to filter and sort your campaign data. For example, target your audiences based on campaign member status, or generate reports to track RSVPs or awareness. Updating Campaign Member Statuses If you plan to use campaign member status as a filtering mechanism in reporting or automation, don’t edit the available member statuses and their settings. If you change the status value or its response setting, it can cause problems where the status is in use and trigger statistics recalculation throughout your reports. Tip To encourage consistency, document your default campaign statuses for internal users. You can also use the Clone with Related tool to copy a campaign and its member statuses the next time you create a similar campaign.

Add Customizable Campaign Influence data in related lists and reports so that your reps can understand which campaigns impact their opportunity pipeline. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ) and Lightning Experience Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Influence models scan active campaigns to identify members who are also assigned a contact role on an open opportunity. A model creates a campaign influence record based on that relationship. Influence can be assigned manually on an opportunity record or automatically via Apex triggers or the API. After an opportunity’s stage is closed (won or lost), influence records are no longer created. Campaign Influence considers every campaign member, regardless of their member status. The Customizable Campaign Influence models rely on the Campaign object, the Opportunity object, and a Campaign Influence junction object. When you enable Customizable Campaign Influence, the standard objects CampaignInfluence and CampaignInfluenceModel are added to your org. You can build a report or dashboard for any active influence model. Access to Campaign Influence Records Campaign influence records are exposed to users through related lists and reports. A related list shows data from one model at a time. Choose which model you want to use, and set it as the default. To allow users to add or edit campaign influence records from opportunity records, the default model must be custom and unlocked. Note In Salesforce Classic, the Influenced Opportunities related list displays an opportunity only if the influence is more than 0%. In Lightning Experience, opportunity records display regardless of influence percentage. Standard vs. Custom Models The Primary Campaign Source model is the default model that comes with Customizable Campaign Influence. It assigns 100% influence to the campaign noted in the Primary Campaign Source field on an opportunity. It uses auto-association, which means users can’t add campaign influence records to the model manually. Influence records created by the Primary Campaign Source model are recalculated when one of these events occurs. Any Customizable Campaign Influence setting is changed An opportunity’s Close Date is changed A member is added or removed from a campaign An account or opportunity is deleted or undeleted If the Primary Campaign Source model doesn’t meet your business needs, you can create custom models. With a custom model, users manually add or edit an influence percentage in the Campaign Influence related list on an opportunity record. Custom model settings are unlocked by default, so that users can update records themselves. When a custom model is locked, it accepts updates via API only. Note Opportunities added by the primary source campaign field appear in Campaign Statistics only when the Primary Source Campaign model is set as the default. If you’re using another model, the value shows opportunities added by auto-association only. The number of custom models you can create varies by your edition. Account Engagement Plus, Advanced, and Premium Editions: 5 Account Engagement Growth Edition: 3 Salesforce Performance and Unlimited Edition: 5 Salesforce Professional and Enterprise Edition: 3 Salesforce Developer Edition: 1 To preserve opportunity data, we don’t delete custom campaign influence records when you delete an associated campaign. You can delete campaign influence records from the Opportunity related list or via the API. Auto-Association Settings Standard campaign influence models use auto-association to create campaign influence records based on the criteria you set. Criteria can include time frame and campaign types, and you can add other filters using standard or custom fields. You can set an auto-association time frame in Setup to limit when a member-contact relationship is considered influential. Auto-association rules work only with standard campaign influence models and don't apply to custom models. More Campaign Influence Models for Marketers For users of both Sales Cloud and Account Engagement, choose whether to enable the Additional Campaign Influence Models: first touch, last touch, and even distribution. When you enable one of these models, auto-association rules support standard fields only. If you can’t or don’t enable these models, your access is limited to the Primary Campaign Source model and custom models only. First-Touch—Assigns 100% of influence and revenue earned to the first campaign a prospect touches. Even if a prospect interacts with other marketing assets or activities, this model attributes all of the influence to the first touch. This model relies on the campaign member’s Created Date and is for Account Engagement users only. Even-Distribution—Assigns an equal percentage of influence and revenue earned to every campaign a prospect touches. This model is for Account Engagement users only. Last-Touch—Assigns 100% of influence and revenue earned to the last campaign a prospect touches before a deal is closed. No matter what other campaigns the prospect has interacted with, this model attributes all influence to the final touchpoint. This model relies on the Last Modified Date of the campaign member and is for Account Engagement users only.

It uses the Campaign Influence object to make connections across contacts, campaigns, and opportunities. Campaign Influence 1.0 isn’t supported in Lightning Experience. To track influential campaigns in Lightning Experience, switch to Customizable Campaign Influence. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Important For new users, Customizable Campaign Influence is enabled by default. Not sure which version of Campaign Influence you have? Search Setup for campaign influence , and check the available pages. If the Model Settings page appears, you’re using Customizable Campaign Influence . Primary Campaign Source Only one campaign in a related list can be marked as the primary campaign source, because it allocates 100% of the attribution to the selected campaign. When you mark a campaign as primary, it’s added to the Primary Campaign Source field on the opportunity. For more flexibility, check out Customizable Campaign Influence. Opportunity statistics, such as Opportunities in Campaign and Won or Closed values, appear only on the campaign marked as the primary source. Opportunity statistics don’t appear on other influential campaign records. Before you select a primary source campaign, consider workflows or Apex rules that are triggered by changes to an opportunity record. Auto-Association Settings With Campaign Influence 1.0, you can choose whether to enable auto-association. When it’s turned on, influential campaigns are automatically added to an open opportunity record when a campaign’s related contact is assigned an opportunity contact role. You can also apply rules that specify which types of campaigns are considered influential. In the Campaign Influence Eligibility Limits section, the time frame field specifies a time period during which a campaign is considered influential. The time frame is the number of days between the date that a contact is added to a campaign and when a related opportunity is created. Eligibility limits work only when a contact is related to a campaign first and then assigned an opportunity contact role. Auto-association ignores contacts who are added to campaigns after the related opportunity is created. Example Admin Kim enables auto-association and enters a Campaign Influence time frame of 10 days. Customer Gerrie engages with an email and their contact record is added to the New Services campaign on June 15. The next day, Gerrie talks to Parul in Sales, and Parul adds them to an opportunity and assigns an opportunity contact role. The New Services campaign is automatically added to the Campaign Influence related list. If Parul doesn’t assign an opportunity contact role to Gerrie, the campaign isn’t added to the related list by auto-association. If Gerrie waits until June 26 to contact Sales, the campaign isn’t considered influential, so it isn’t added to the related list.

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: All Account Engagement Editions with Salesforce Essentials, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Before You Start Create an equivalent Salesforce campaign for each Account Engagement campaign, including the default Account Engagement campaigns Website Tracking, Email Plug-In, and Salesforce Sync. Organize and dedupe existing Account Engagement campaigns. Create the Salesforce record types that you plan to use when syncing campaigns. Requirements Connected Campaigns requires a verified Salesforce connector, a Salesforce login, and an admin to enable the feature. For the best experience, don’t turn off Connected Campaigns after you turn it on. About Record Types Important Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations. To limit which counterpart campaigns are created in Account Engagement, use record types with Connected Campaigns. In the Connected Campaigns settings, you can deselect record types, if they aren’t needed. For best performance, use record types to sync only the campaigns that you expect to connect frequently. It takes time to load all the campaigns in the menu that you use to connect Salesforce campaigns—the fewer campaigns to choose from, the better. The Master record type is the default record type for new records. To avoid syncing unnecessary Salesforce campaigns, we recommend that you don’t choose this record type. Work with your Salesforce admin to create alternate record types. To connect more than one Account Engagement business unit to a single Salesforce org, create different campaign record types for each business unit. After You Connect Campaigns Salesforce copies marketing forms, marketing links, and list emails from Account Engagement campaigns to their connected Salesforce campaigns. This data counts against your company’s data storage limits. The Account Engagement campaign record becomes read-only, so always create campaigns from the Campaigns tab in Salesforce. When campaigns are connected, Salesforce replaces the values of these Account Engagement campaign fields, which can’t be undone. Name Archive Date (maps to End Date on Salesforce campaigns) Cost Created By Updated By Updated At Some actions associated with Account Engagement campaigns are removed. The Add Campaign and Connect to CRM Campaign actions no longer appear on the Account Engagement Campaigns tab, and the Account Engagement Campaigns recycling bin is no longer available. You can use only active campaigns in automations and completion actions. Note To support Account Engagement features available within Sales Cloud, Salesforce added a user called B2BMA Integration User to all Salesforce customers who also have Account Engagement. This new user is read-only, doesn’t affect your Salesforce license usage, and can’t access or update data by default. If you choose to opt in to the new Account Engagement features available in Sales Cloud, this user enables campaign and engagement data to be shared and copied between the two systems.

Available in: Salesforce Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with any Account Engagement Edition How It Works Warning After you turn on Campaign Member Sync, we recommend that you keep it enabled at all times. The configuration affects other processes and can cause data discrepancies if it’s disabled later. Campaign Member Sync shows your prospects in Salesforce as campaign members. The sync works only from Account Engagement to Salesforce, so campaign member changes aren’t reflected in associated Account Engagement campaigns. Before you can use member sync, Connected Campaigns must be enabled. To sync a prospect, assign it to an Account Engagement user and associate it with an Account Engagement campaign. To indicate that a first touch came from an Account Engagement campaign, synced campaign members show a status of Connected. If a campaign member is missing or doesn’t show a Connected status, verify that the prerequisites for syncing have been met. The connector user or integration user has Edit permission on Campaigns. Marketing User is selected on its Salesforce user record. To add campaign members after the first touch, create a completion action. For more recent marketing engagement activity, view the prospect record. Other Considerations If the prospect shares an email address with another Salesforce contact, the record is synced as a contact. Otherwise, the prospect syncs as a lead. When you enable Campaign Member Sync, prospects sync retroactively for campaigns that are already connected. Campaign Member Sync doesn’t archive or delete lead or contact records from Salesforce. Remove associated records from Salesforce manually. The campaign member created date in Salesforce refers to when the prospect was synced, not the creation date in Account Engagement. Campaign Member Sync works alongside other prospect syncing jobs. Expect slower sync times when a connected campaign has more than 10,000 prospects. "

You can also redirect prospects to other web pages that are critical to campaign success. and User Permissions Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs ) and Lightning Experience Available in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions User Permissions Needed To set up Web-to-Lead: Customize Application To be the default lead creator for Web-to-Lead: Modify all Data AND Send Email If you want to use spam filtering, you must have a reCAPTCHA key pair. Keep in mind that enabling reCAPTCHA is optional. Important reCAPTCHA is provided by Google. Make sure that reCAPTCHA is supported in your geography. From Setup, enter Web-to-Lead in the Quick Find box, then select Web-to-Lead . To enable or change Web-to-Lead settings, click Edit . Optionally, select Require reCAPTCHA Verification to reduce spam and reject leads without verification. In orgs created after Winter ’19, this setting is enabled by default. Optionally, specify a Default Lead Creator . This user is listed as Creator when a Lead is created online. The default lead creator must have the Modify all Data and Send Email permissions and they must both be granted via a permission set or a user profile. Don't use a combination of a permission set and a user profile to grant these permissions to this user. Optionally, specify a Default Response Template if you want to automate email replies to prospects. You can set up response rules to use different email templates based on the information prospects provide. If you do, the default response template is used when no auto-response rules apply. Templates must be marked Available for Use . Click Save . To create a form that captures prospect details on your website, click Create Web-to-Lead Form , and then select fields you want to include. Select fields to include on your Web-to-Lead form. Use the Add and Remove arrows to move fields between the Available Fields list and the Selected Fields list. Use the Up and Down arrows to change the order of the fields on your form. Select the Campaign field. For organizations using multiple currencies, add the Lead Currency field if you add currency amount fields, otherwise all amounts are captured in your corporate currency. Use a custom multi-select picklist to allow potential customers to express interest in several products. For organizations using lead record types, select the Lead Record Type field if you want users to select a record type for Web-generated leads. If your organization uses the Translation Workbench or has renamed tabs, select the language for the form labels displayed on your Web-to-Lead form. The source of your Web-to-Lead form is always in your personal language. Specify the complete URL to direct users to after they submit their information and then click Generate . For example, you can use your company's home page for a thank you page. If you want to add a reCAPTCHA widget to the lead submission form, select Include reCAPTCHA in HTML . This setting is automatically selected and is read-only when Require reCAPTCHA Verification is enabled. Note If Include reCAPTCHA in HTML is selected but Require reCAPTCHA Verification isn’t, existing forms without reCAPTCHA keep working and continue to generate leads. We recommend that you enable Require reCAPTCHA Verification and then ensure that your HTML on your website includes the reCAPTCHA validation code. Specify the reCAPTCHA API Key Pair using the lookup. If you want to allow all traffic in the case that the Google reCAPTCHA servers aren’t available, select Enable server fallback . Copy the generated HTML code and provide it to your company's webmaster so they can incorporate it into your website. Click Finished . To test the Web-to-Lead form, uncomment these three lines in your code by removing the <!-- and --> from the beginning and end of each line. <!-- <input type=""hidden"" name=""debug"" value=1> --> <!-- <input type=""hidden"" name=""debugEmail"" --> <!-- value=""<<add emailId here>>""> --> Replace <<add emailId here>> with your email address. When you submit the form, an email with debugging information is sent to that address. Remove these three lines or recomment them before releasing the Web-to-Lead page to your website. Leads generated from your website are initially marked with the “default status” specified by the Lead Status picklist. For web leads generated as part of a campaign, the member status of the new leads is set to the Member Status value specified in the form. If the Member Status field isn’t included in the form, the member status is set to the value you specify as the “default”. If you include the Campaign ID field on your form, Salesforce automatically inserts the lead as a campaign member. If you do, don’t create any triggers or processes that insert campaign members from the generated leads. In addition, new leads are marked as “Unread,” and are changed to “Read” when viewed or edited by the lead owner. Users can select the My Unread Leads list view to quickly locate their new leads. Note Keep the following things in mind when setting up and working with Web-to-Lead. The format for date and currency fields captured online is taken from your organization’s default settings - Default Locale and Currency Locale . The daily limit for Web-to-Lead requests is 500. If your organization exceeds its daily Web-to-Lead limit, the Default Lead Creator (specified in the Web-to-Lead setup page) receives an email informing them the daily limit has been exceeded. If a new lead can’t be generated due to errors in your Web-to-Lead setup, Customer Support is notified so we can help you correct it. Salesforce provides the standard Web-to-Lead form but can't support specific modifications to the form. Before creating records submitted via Web-to-Lead, Salesforce runs field validation rules. If any field values are invalid, no lead record is created. All universally required fields must have a value before a record can be created via Web-to-Lead. Salesforce doesn't support rich text area (RTA) fields on Web-to-Lead forms. If you use RTA fields on your forms, any information entered in them is saved as plain text when the lead is created. Salesforce retains the original format of email addresses for web-generated leads. For example, JohnDoe@gmail.com is saved as is, not as johndoe@gmail.com. Web-to-Lead forms don’t validate the email address field. To validate email addresses of web-generated leads, create a validation rule for the Email field on leads.

LinkedIn Lead Gen forms let you ask up to 3 custom questions of your leads. For example, you can ask what their occupation is. When LinkedIn sends leads to Salesforce, it includes the text of each question and answer. Use a lead field to store each question and another for the answer provided by the lead. This way you can report on questions and answers by filtering leads by questions asked, using the fields you choose for the questions. Under Consent Fields, choose the custom lead fields to capture data from your LinkedIn form consent fields. LinkedIn consent fields let you track leads’ preferences about communication and privacy. For example, you can have a consent called “Send me email” with a checkbox. In Setup, map one field to hold the name of the consent, “Send me email”. Map another field to hold the response provided by the lead, either yes or no. Under Hidden Fields, choose the custom lead fields to capture data from your LinkedIn form hidden fields. To capture campaign-specific data for each lead, use LinkedIn hidden fields. Salesforce sorts LinkedIn hidden fields into alphabetical order by field name before writing the values to the mapped fields. The first field in alphabetical order is always written to the first mapped field, and so on. Be sure to map the LinkedIn hidden fields to your Salesforce fields in alphabetical order. Note Don’t change the field type of fields you map for LinkedIn Lead Gen. Doing so can cause the mapping to fail. See Also Generate Leads from Your Website for Your Sales Teams Loading "

To view the leads in a queue, choose that queue list from the dropdown list. For every queue your administrator creates, Salesforce adds a corresponding queue list view. The org-wide sharing model for an object determines the access users have to that object’s records in queues: Public Read/Write/Transfer: Users can view and take ownership of records from any queue. Public Read/Write or Public Read Only: Users can view any queue but only take ownership of records from queues of which they’re a member or, depending on sharing settings, if they’re higher in the role or territory hierarchy than a queue member. Private: Users can only view and accept records from queues of which they’re a member or, depending on sharing settings, if they’re higher in the role or territory hierarchy than a queue member. Regardless of the sharing model, users must have the “Edit” permission to take ownership of records in queues of which they’re a member.

If so, we show you a warning. Custom warnings set up by your administrator don’t appear during lead conversion. When you begin to convert a lead, possible matches appear based on matching rules using standard fields. When you click Convert , additional matches can appear based on matching rules using custom fields. How these duplicate records are handled depends on how your Salesforce admin has set up Apex Lead Convert and Duplicate Management. For example, your administrator can require that you resolve the duplicates before you finish converting. If your admin has created any cross-object duplicate rules, they aren't triggered during lead conversion. Keep in mind that you can’t reverse lead conversion. After it’s converted, a lead record is no longer searchable, unless your admin assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. The new account, contact, or opportunity record created from the converted lead is searchable. In Lightning Experience, both the converted lead record and the new record based on the converted lead are searchable. However, you can’t view or edit the converted lead record from the search results page. When converting a lead, attached files or notes become attached to the contact, account, and opportunity records you associate with the converted lead. If you use Sales Engagement, the lead’s completed cadence tasks don’t appear on the Activity Timeline of the new contact, account, or opportunity. In a lead record, choose to convert the lead. Enter a name for an account that you’re creating, or select an existing account. Salesforce Classic only: If you update a person account, select the option to overwrite the lead source in the person account with the value from the lead. Select a contact, or enter a name for a contact that you’re creating. Enter a name for an opportunity that you’re creating, or, in Lightning Experience, select an existing opportunity. Up to 20 matching opportunities appear in the list. Convert the lead. Optionally, create a follow-up task. Note Some long-time Salesforce customers are still using an older lead convert process built with PLSQL instead of Apex. If your org uses Lightning Experience and the old lead convert process, the convert window has fewer options. To use the newest lead conversion window, your org must have enabled Apex Lead Convert. With its increased capability, flexibility, and efficiency, the newest lead convert window is a great reason to make the free switch to Apex Lead Convert. To enable Apex Lead Convert, see this Knowledge article and then contact Salesforce Support. See Also Considerations for Converting Leads Troubleshoot Lead Conversion "

This warning occurs when all the following conditions exist. Accounts has an active duplicate rule with matching rule criteria that refer to account fields that are mapped for lead conversion. Any of the mapped fields referenced by the duplicate rule are blank on the existing account. The lead field values that populate the blank account fields match another account record. When fields are mapped from leads to accounts for lead conversion, blank fields on the account that you are converting to are updated with the values from the lead. However, in this situation, you can’t ignore the duplicate warning and convert to the existing account. Salesforce asks you to choose one of the accounts identified as a duplicate or to convert to a new account. To resolve this issue and convert to your chosen existing account,. choose one of these options. Cancel the lead conversion, and populate the blank mapped fields on the account before restarting the conversion. Remove the values from the lead for the mapped fields that are blank on the account. If you aren’t sure which fields are mapped for lead conversion, consult your admin. See Also Convert Qualified Leads Considerations for Converting Leads "

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud When you convert qualified leads, Salesforce moves any campaign members to the new contacts. The leads become read-only records, unless your administrator gives you permission to edit them. Salesforce attaches all activities from the converted lead to the resulting account, contact, and opportunity, except activities initiated from a Sales Engagement cadence. If you delete one of these activities from any of the resulting records, Salesforce also removes it from the other records. To restore an activity to all resulting records, remove it from the recycle bin. You can assign the owners of these new records, and schedule follow-up tasks. When you assign new owners, only the open activities are assigned to the new owner. If you have custom lead fields, that information can be inserted into custom account, contact, or opportunity fields. Your admin can also set up your custom lead fields to populate custom account, contact, and opportunity fields automatically. You can’t view converted leads, unless your admin has assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. However, converted leads do appear in lead reports. Salesforce updates the Last Modified Date and Last Modified By system fields on converted leads when picklist values included on converted leads are changed. Apex Triggers During lead conversion, triggers fire. Universally required custom fields and validation rules are enforced. When updating a lead, triggers that cause the lead to convert can cause a warning. The warning indicates that the lead is no longer accessible to the user because it’s been converted to a contact. Refer to the new contact instead. If the Require Validation for Converted Leads checkbox on the Lead Settings page is deselected, Salesforce ignores lookup filters when converting leads. Converting leads with many associated events and tasks, or converting leads to accounts or contacts, can result in Apex governor limit errors, especially if there are triggers on the objects. See Apex Governor Limits . Campaigns A lead can match an existing contact. If both records are linked to the same campaign, the campaign member status is determined by whichever is further along in the campaign lifecycle. For example, if the lead member status is “sent” and the contact member status is “responded”, the responded value is applied to the contact. Related campaign information is always associated with the new contact record, regardless of the user's sharing access to the campaign. When more than one campaign is associated with a lead, the most recently associated campaign is applied to the Primary Campaign Source field for the opportunity, regardless of the user's sharing access to the campaign. Chatter When you convert a lead to an existing account, you don’t automatically follow that account. However, when you convert the lead to a new account, you automatically follow the new account, unless you disabled feed tracking for accounts in your Chatter settings. Contacts to Multiple Accounts If your organization uses Contacts to Multiple Accounts, when you convert a lead to an existing contact, Salesforce creates a relationship record that connects the contact to the lead’s account. Divisions The new account, contact, and opportunity are assigned to the same division as the lead. If you update an existing account during lead conversion, the account’s division isn’t changed, and the new contact and opportunity inherit the account’s division. Duplicate Management When you convert leads to contacts or accounts, the process sometimes creates duplicate records. If so, we show you a warning. Custom warnings set up by your administrator don’t appear during lead conversion. When you begin to convert a lead, possible matches appear based on matching rules using standard fields. When you click Convert , additional matches can appear based on matching rules using custom fields. How these duplicate records are handled depends on how your Salesforce admin has set up Apex Lead Convert and Duplicate Management. For example, your administrator can require that you resolve the duplicates before you finish converting. If your admin has created any cross-object duplicate rules, they aren't triggered during lead conversion. Enterprise Territory Management Filter-based opportunity territory assignment isn’t triggered when an opportunity is created through lead conversion. Existing Accounts and Contacts When updating existing accounts or contacts during lead conversion, the values of mapped lead fields don’t overwrite the values of the mapped account and contact fields. If existing accounts and contacts share the names specified on the leads, you can choose to update the existing accounts and contacts. Salesforce adds information from the lead into empty fields on the contact and account. Salesforce doesn’t overwrite existing account and contact data with any lead data. For the composite address field, which is made up of several individual fields, Salesforce only adds information to empty individual fields on the contact and account. When the State and Country/Territory picklists are enabled, the State/Province and Country fields on the lead only transfer to the existing contact when both the State/Province and Country fields on the contact aren't set. Be sure to verify the resulting data on the contact and account after lead conversion. Health Cloud The fields Specialty and Birth Date are available for use only in Health Cloud. They don’t map to any fields when you convert a lead because they don’t have equivalents on an account, contact, or opportunity. List Emails When a lead converts, list email activities associated with the lead become associated with the contact but aren’t associated with the resulting opportunity. Local Lead Names Company Name (Local) on the lead automatically maps to Account Name (Local), along with their associated standard name fields. New Accounts and Contacts When new accounts or contacts are created during lead conversion, the values of mapped lead fields overwrite the default values of the mapped account and contact fields. Opportunity Contact Roles If there are required custom fields added to the Opportunity Contact Role object, users can't create opportunities during lead conversion. Because there's no field mapping between leads and opportunity contact roles, the required custom field can't be populated. Person Accounts With person accounts enabled, you can convert leads to either person accounts or business accounts. In Lightning Experience, leads that don’t have a value in the Company field are converted to person accounts. Leads that do have a value in the Company field are converted to business accounts. In Salesforce Classic and the Salesforce mobile app, leads without company information can still be converted to an existing business account. To differentiate leads that convert to person accounts from leads that convert to business accounts, use different lead record types and page layouts. Specifically, remove the Company field from the page layouts for leads that convert to person accounts. Then, make the Company field required on the page layouts for leads that convert to business accounts. In the Salesforce mobile app, you can't convert a lead to a person account if the person account name already exists. Record Types If the lead has a record type, the default record type of the user converting the lead is assigned to records created during lead conversion. The default record type of the user converting the lead determines the lead source values available during conversion. If the desired lead source values aren’t available, add the values to the default record type of the user converting the lead. For accounts, users can set an overall default record type as well as subdefault record types for business accounts and person accounts. When converting leads, the overall default record type is used. Lead conversion doesn’t use subdefault record types. Salesforce to Salesforce When you convert a lead, Salesforce to Salesforce inactivates the shared record and updates the External Sharing related list in your connection's lead record with an Inactive (converted) status. Due to inactivation of the shared record, changes to the Lead Status during conversion aren't reflected in your connection's lead record. Search Whether a converted lead is searchable differs for Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. Salesforce Classic: After converting a lead, it’s no longer searchable. However, the new account, contact, or opportunity record created from the converted lead is searchable. Lightning Experience: The converted lead record and the newly created account, contact, or opportunity record are searchable. However, you can’t access the converted lead record from the search results page to view or edit it. As you type the lead name in the search box, you might see search suggestions for leads that you already merged as duplicates. A delay in removing these converted leads from the search index causes this issue. Standard and Custom Lead Fields The system automatically maps standard lead fields to standard account, contact, and opportunity fields. For custom lead fields, your administrator can specify how they map to custom account, contact, and opportunity fields. The system assigns the default picklist values for the account, contact, and opportunity when mapping standard lead picklist fields that are blank. If your organization uses record types, blank values are replaced with the default picklist values of the new record owner. Converting a lead sets the Unread field to false. The lead's ConvertedDate field contains the date the lead was converted based on the current date in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This field appears in some reports and shows the GMT date not adjusted to the user's local time zone. The value stored in the lead's CreatedDate field includes both the date and time and is converted to the user's time zone. Workflow You can't convert a lead that’s associated with an active approval process or has pending workflow actions. Converting a lead to a person account doesn’t trigger workflow rules. When a lead is converted by someone who isn't the lead owner, all workflow tasks associated with the lead that are assigned to that user, except email alerts, are reassigned to the lead owner. Workflow tasks assigned to users other than the lead owner and lead converter aren't changed. If validation and triggers for lead conversion are enabled, then converting a lead can trigger a workflow action on a lead. For example, if an active workflow rule updates a lead field or transfers the owner of a lead, that rule can trigger when the lead is converted. However, because of the conversion, the lead isn’t visible on the Leads tab. Allow the workflow process to finish before updating lead fields, otherwise save or lead convert fails. A workflow rule can create a task because of a lead conversion. In that case, Salesforce assigns the task to the new contact and relates it to the associated account or opportunity. When you convert a lead, files and related records attached to the lead are attached to the resulting contact, account, and opportunity records. Items from the following related lists on leads are carried over to the new or existing contact, account, and opportunity during lead conversion. Lead Related List Contact Account Person Account Opportunity Open Activities Activity History Campaign History HTML Email Status Notes and Attachments Files Notes (new) Content Deliveries Social Posts When Social Customer Service is turned on. When Social Customer Service is turned on. Social Personas When Social Customer Service is turned on. When Social Customer Service is turned on. Marketing Actions Other related records from custom objects aren’t attached to the resulting contact, account, and opportunity records. See Also Convert Qualified Leads Troubleshoot Lead Conversion "

You can merge a converted lead with a non-converted lead, as long as the non-converted lead is selected as the master record. To merge converted leads, use Lightning Experience instead. "

Mapping custom fields helps your sales reps retain that important information when they convert qualified leads to track new potential deals. Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud The following Lead custom field types can only be mapped to custom fields of the same data type. Checkbox Currency Date Date/Time Email Geolocation Encrypted (Classic) Number Percent Phone Multi-select Picklist Long Text Rich Text URL Each target field can have only one source field mapped to it. You can map auto-number fields to field types text or text area. You can map text and text area fields to custom field types of text, text area, long text, and picklist. If you map to a picklist field, the picklist must be unrestricted. You can map custom picklist fields to custom field types of text, text area, and picklist (unrestricted), but not long text. When mapping between picklist and text fields, your data truncates if the source field value is longer than the target field allows. Custom lookup fields can be mapped to a lookup field pointing to the same object. For example, a lead custom lookup field pointing to the Account object can be mapped to a contact custom lookup field that also points to the Account object. When mapping custom lead fields, the selected account, contact, or opportunity field must be of equal or greater length. You can’t delete lead, account, contact, or opportunity fields included in Lead Custom Field Mapping. To delete a field, first remove its mapping. You can’t change the field type of a field that’s included in Lead Custom Field Mapping. To change a field’s type, remove its mapping first. When you uninstall a package that references fields included in Lead Custom Field Mapping, those custom field mappings are deleted automatically. When mapping lead custom number, currency, or percent fields, the target field must have the same length and number of decimal places. If you have more than 500 lead fields, the lead field mapping page can become unresponsive. Dependent picklist fields on leads can’t have a default value assigned. These fields are driven from the value selected in the controlling picklist field. Field mappings defined between a controlling and dependent picklist are validated during lead conversion. These mappings don’t allow any values other than the current value of the controlling picklist to be assigned to the dependent picklist. In Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, custom field mapping for lead conversion is available in orgs that use APEX Lead Convert. Custom field mapping for lead convert is not available in orgs that use the older PLSQL Lead Convert. In orgs that use APEX Lead Convert, contact, account, and opportunity fields with field-level security settings are populated from mapped lead fields. Note Don’t map custom formula fields to other formula fields or any other type of field. "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Starter, Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Pro Suite, and Developer Editions with Sales Cloud What Is a Lead? Leads are people who are interested in your product and service. Converting leads to loyal customers provide success within a business. By managing your leads in a systematic and structured way, you can increase both the numbers of leads you generate and how many leads you convert. What are the advantages of using leads? Using leads allows your company to maintain two separate lists - one for prospective customers and one for existing customers. You can store your prospects as leads, and then when a lead becomes qualified, you can convert it to an account, contact, and, optionally, an opportunity. Can I automatically email leads that come from my website? Yes. You can create auto-response rules to email these prospects using templates that vary based on criteria that you set up. Can I capture leads from multiple web pages? Yes. Insert the generated HTML code into the web pages from which you want to capture leads. Whenever someone submits information on any of those web pages, a lead is created. Can I convert existing accounts or contacts into leads? No. As an alternative, create an opportunity for the account or contact. If you prefer to use a lead, create a report containing the accounts or contacts you want to convert into leads, export them, and then import them as leads. How are lead fields mapped to other fields during conversion? When you convert a lead, data in standard lead fields is transferred into standard account, contact, and opportunity fields. For custom lead fields, the data is mapped to custom account, contact, and opportunity fields as specified by your admin. How can I be sure that leads aren’t lost? The daily limit for Web-to-Lead requests is 500. If your organization exceeds its daily Web-to-Lead limit, the Default Lead Creator (specified in the Web-to-Lead setup page) receives an email containing the additional lead information. How can I tell which of my leads are new? When a lead is assigned to you, either manually transferred, imported, or generated from the web, the lead is marked as “Unread,” that is, it has a check mark in the Unread column on leads list views. How can our webmaster test the Web-to-Lead page? Add the following line to your Web-to-Lead page code if you want to see a debugging page when you submit the form. Don't forget to remove this line before releasing the Web-to-Lead page on your website. How many leads can we capture from our website? In Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance, and Developer Edition organizations, you can capture up to 500 leads in a 24-hour period. What happens when I convert leads? When you convert a lead, Salesforce creates an account, contact, and optionally an opportunity, using information from the lead you’re converting. What if my company reaches the limit for web-generated leads? The daily limit for Web-to-Lead requests is 500. If your company generates more leads than the maximum allowed, the Default Lead Creator (specified in the Web-to-Lead setup page) receives an email containing the captured information. Contact Customer Support if your company wants to generate over 500 Web-to-Lead requests per day. What status is assigned to web-generated leads? All new web leads are marked with a status equal to the “default status” that your administrator selects when editing the Lead Status picklist values Who owns new web-generated leads? Your administrator can create a lead assignment rule to determine how web leads are automatically assigned to different users or queues. Loading "

When you convert a lead, Salesforce creates an account, contact, and optionally an opportunity, using information from the lead you’re converting. If the lead was also a campaign member, Salesforce associates the campaign member record with the new contact. The converted lead becomes a read-only record. If existing accounts and contacts share the names specified on the leads, you can choose to update the existing accounts and contacts. Salesforce adds information from the lead into empty contact fields; Salesforce doesn’t overwrite existing account and contact data. When you convert a lead to a new or existing contact, Salesforce adds the contactCreatedByLead or contactUpdatedByLead system field to the contact. You can see these fields in the History related list for the contact. The value of these fields is null; their presence on a contact indicates that the contact was created or updated from a lead. Salesforce attaches all activities from the converted lead to the resulting account, contact, and opportunity, except activities initiated from a Sales Engagement cadence. If you delete one of these activities from any of the resulting records, Salesforce also removes it from the other records. To restore an activity to all resulting records, remove it from the recycle bin. You can assign the owners of these new records, and schedule follow-up tasks. When you assign new owners, only the open activities are assigned to the new owner. If you have custom lead fields, that information can be inserted into custom account, contact, or opportunity fields. Your admin can also set up your custom lead fields to populate custom account, contact, and opportunity fields automatically. You can’t view converted leads, unless your admin has assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. However, converted leads do appear in lead reports. Salesforce updates the Last Modified Date and Last Modified By system fields on converted leads when picklist values included on converted leads are changed. After it’s converted, a lead record is no longer searchable, unless your admin assigned you the View and Edit Converted Leads permission. The new account, contact, or opportunity record created from the converted lead is searchable. "

Products and Price Books Products are a base catalog of all the items and services you sell and their standard prices. Price Books let you create a custom collection of products with associated list prices for specific uses. Opportunities Track and manage your potential deals with Salesforce opportunities. Opportunities are deals in progress. Opportunity records track details about deals, including which accounts they’re for, who the players are, and the amount of potential sales. If your Salesforce admin has set up leads in your Salesforce org, an opportunity is created when a lead is converted. Opportunities can also be created directly for accounts you’re working. Quotes Quotes in Salesforce represent the proposed prices of your company’s products and services. You create a quote from an opportunity and its products. Each opportunity can have multiple associated quotes, and any one of them can be synced with the opportunity. When a quote and an opportunity are synced, any change to line items in the quote syncs with products on the opportunity, and vice versa. Get an overview of all your quotes on the Quotes tab. And if you’re using Lightning Experience, track sales activity in Path and stages in Kanban. Contracts A contract is a written agreement between parties. Many companies use contracts to define the terms for doing business with other companies. Use Salesforce to establish and document the contracts that you have with your accounts and opportunities. Track the contract through your approval process. And use workflow alerts to remind yourself of contract renewals. Orders Use orders to track your customers’ requests for products and services. "

Products, product schedules, price books, and quotes available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Orders available in Salesforce Classic Products, product schedules, price books, and orders available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Quotes available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud The following price types are available. A standard price is the default price that you associate with a product. It’s automatically included in your standard price book. A list price is the custom price that you associate with a product in a custom price book. For example, you can maintain one set of prices for domestic orders and another for international orders. Sales prices are the actual prices that sales reps specify for the products that they add to opportunities and quotes. Sales prices can be the same as the list prices from the price book that’s used for the opportunity or quote, or they can include discounts or other modifications. Before you can add a new product to an opportunity, quote, or custom price book, add a standard price to the product, and mark it as active. This pricing is the default pricing of the product. Before you can assign list prices for products, create custom price books. List prices are available to use when you add products to an opportunity or quote from a custom price book. To represent the price, for example, $100.00, enter 100 or 100.00 , with or without the $ symbol. You can expand the format of your price fields to up to eight decimal places. To change your decimal place settings, contact Salesforce. Considerations When Using the Salesforce Classic User Interface You can add standard or list prices only through the multiline add pages (the Add Standard Price page and the Add List Price page). These pages don’t support custom fields. To add standard or list prices and populate custom fields, add the price book entry via the multiline add pages, navigate to the Price Book Entry Edit page for the added record, and then update the custom fields. Note This consideration doesn’t affect price book entries that were created or edited by using Data Loader or the API.

In Lightning Experience, customize schedules with custom fields, custom buttons, customized layout, validation rules, and Apex triggers. Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions A quantity schedule determines when a product is delivered. A revenue schedule determines when a product is paid for. A default schedule is associated with a specific product in a specific price book. Every time the product is added to an opportunity, the default schedule is used. You can override the default schedules on any opportunity. You determine which types of schedules your reps can use and which types of schedules can be established for each individual product. A quantity schedule is suitable if your customers pay once but receive the product in increments, for example, as with an annual magazine subscription for a monthly magazine. A quantity schedule defines the dates, number of units, and number of installments for payments, shipping, or other use as determined by your company. A revenue schedule is suitable if your customers make regular payments but receive the product once, for example, if you sell customized products that are charged in installments but delivered once. A revenue schedule defines the dates, revenue amounts, and number of installments for payments, recognizing revenue, or other use. A revenue and quantity schedule is suitable if your customers receive their orders on a delivery schedule and pay for the products using a payment schedule, for example, a monthly product subscription that’s paid for monthly. A default schedule is suitable if all your customers make product payments on the same timetable or you deliver products on a regular schedule. If you typically customize schedules, there’s no advantage to creating default schedules. When you enable customizable product schedules, the Salesforce Classic actions on product schedules are disabled, and Line Item Schedule is added to the object manager. In Salesforce Classic, product schedules become read-only. Enable Product Schedules Create default revenue and quantity schedules for products that are delivered or paid for over time. Let users create schedules for individual products on opportunities. In Lightning Experience, enable customizable product schedules to tailor schedule layouts with custom fields and buttons and to apply validation rules and Apex triggers. Considerations for Using Product Schedules Consider key points and review examples before you add product schedules, establish schedules on opportunity products, or enable customizable product schedules.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Considerations for Enabling and Disabling Customizable Product Schedules Insert or delete Apex triggers that you’ve applied to schedules are invoked immediately. Line Item Schedule is unavailable in Process Builder and Workflow. You can use custom fields and customize the layout in default product schedules, but if you’ve applied validation rules or Apex triggers, they’re bypassed when they’re first inserted. In addition, the layout of the OpportunityLineItemSchedule related list on the OpportunityLineItem page is customizable in Lightning Experience regardless of whether you’ve enabled customizable product schedules. If schedules are referenced in Apex, only one of the schedule types (quantity or revenue) can be disabled. For example, if Apex references the schedule object (represented as OpportunityLineItemSchedule in the code), one of the schedule types can be disabled, but not both. Considerations for Using Default Product Schedules If you add or change a product schedule, opportunities with that product aren’t updated. If a product has a default quantity schedule and a default revenue schedule, the quantity schedule is calculated first to determine the total product revenue. Then the revenue schedule is applied to that amount. If you have a quote line item with a discount, and the corresponding product record has a default schedule, you can’t edit the Discount field. If a product has default schedules established on the product record, the schedules are automatically created when you add the product to the opportunity. The dates of the installments begin with the date that you specified when adding the product. If you didn’t specify a product date, the installment dates begin with the opportunity Close Date. On default product schedules, we don’t support the type Repeat Amount for each installment for both quantity and revenue schedule types. You can set up repeat schedules for both quantity and revenue schedule types from the Schedules related list on an opportunity product record. In Lightning Experience, the Schedules related list on an opportunity product shows the default revenue schedule and the default quantity schedule as two separate items. In Salesforce Classic, the related list combines the schedules in a single item. When customizable product schedules are enabled, default field values and formulas aren’t supported by default product schedules. If amounts can’t be evenly divided when quantity or revenue schedules are enabled, the remaining amounts are placed into the final schedule period. Examples of Using Default Product Schedules Default Revenue Schedule Only: Your ASP company sells yearly contracts of product licenses at $1,200 per license. When a customer buys licenses, the licenses are all “delivered” at one time, but you recognize the revenue monthly. In this case, set a revenue schedule of Schedule Type=Divide, Installment Period=Monthly, and Number of Installments=12. With this default revenue schedule, a salesperson sells 200 licenses at a unit price of $1,200 per license per year on an opportunity on March 15. The 200 licenses are all “delivered” on March 15. The total revenue for this product is the quantity of 200 multiplied by the unit price of $1,200 per year, for a total yearly revenue of $240,000. The revenue schedule divides the total revenue into monthly installments of $20,000 on the 15th of every month for the next year. Default Quantity Schedule Only: Your medical supplies company sells a box of tongue depressors for $10 per box. You normally have yearly contracts with hospitals to deliver boxes monthly. In this case, set a quantity schedule of Schedule Type=Repeat, Installment Period=Monthly, and Number of Installments=12. With this default quantity schedule, a salesperson sells 1,000 boxes on an opportunity on January 1. The quantity schedule creates 12 monthly installments of 1,000 boxes each, for a total quantity of 12,000 boxes. The total revenue from this opportunity is calculated using the unit price and the total quantity, so $120,000 is booked on January 1. Default Quantity and Revenue Schedules: Your manufacturing company sells widgets for $10 each. You normally have yearly contracts to deliver widgets weekly, but your customers pay quarterly. In this case, set a quantity schedule of Schedule Type=Repeat, Installment Period=Weekly, and Number of Installments=52. Set a revenue schedule of Schedule Type=Divide, Installment Period=Quarterly, and Number of Installments=4. With these default schedules, a salesperson sells 2,000 widgets on an opportunity on January 1. The quantity schedule is applied first, and it schedules 2,000 widgets to be delivered every week for a year, for a total quantity of 104,000. The total revenue is calculated using the unit price and the total quantity. The total revenue of $1,040,000 is then divided into quarterly installments of $260,000. "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions A price book is a list of products and their prices. The standard price book is the master list of all your products and their default standard prices . Salesforce creates the standard price book when you start creating product records. It includes all your products and their standard prices regardless of any custom price books that include those products. A custom price book is a separate list of products with custom prices, called list prices . Custom price books are ideal for offering products at different prices to different market segments, regions, or other subsets of your customers. Create a separate price book for each set of customers that you want to address. For example, if you have one set of prices for domestic customers and another for international customers, create a domestic price book and an international one. A price book entry is a product with its price as listed in a price book. Each price book entry specifies a currency for the price. Standard price book entries are the default (standard) prices for the products and services in the standard price book. When you create a product record, Salesforce creates a standard price book entry. You can mark the standard price book entry as active or inactive, depending, for example, on whether you intend to start selling the product right away. Custom price book entries are the custom (list) prices for the products and services in your custom price books. Custom price book entries can be created only for products with active standard price book entries. In Lightning Experience, Product detail pages display the Standard Price related list and the Price Books related list as a single Price Books related list. If you customize the Price Book Entry detail page layout, no field dependencies exist for price book entry fields in the user interface. If the Use Standard Price checkbox is removed from the page layout, and this checkbox is selected for a price book entry, you can’t edit the list price. The List Price field is disabled and can’t be enabled on this page. Create Custom Price Books Create custom price books for each market segment that your sales reps sell to. Then add products to each price book with the prices that you offer each market segment. For example, if you sell to domestic and international customers at different prices, you can create two custom price books: a domestic one and an international one. Considerations for Creating and Maintaining Price Books Before you create a price book, consider a few key points. Guidelines for Sharing Price Books Extend access to price books to more of your sales team members through sharing in Salesforce Classic. Considerations for Removing Price Books To remove price books from related lists, you can archive, deactivate, or delete the price books. Each removal option has a different result. Before you remove a price book from your related lists, determine which option best fits your business needs.

Products, product schedules, price books, and quotes available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Orders available in Salesforce Classic Products, product schedules, price books, and orders available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Quotes available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud You can use the Salesforce mobile app to relate a price book with an opportunity that doesn’t have one. To change an opportunity’s price book, use the desktop Salesforce site. When you remove a product or price book, all related price book entries are removed. However, if several price books contain the same product, removing the product from one price book doesn't affect the other price books. Similarly, if you remove a price book, the products that it contained aren’t removed from any other price book. To remove a product completely, remove it from the standard price book. If opportunities, quotes, service contracts, or contract line items are associated with a product, you can’t remove the product. You can’t remove a product or price book that’s associated with an approval process or has a pending workflow action. If your product or price book is used on an opportunity, quote, or order, you have three options. Deactivate it by editing it and then deselecting the Active field. We recommend deactivating a product or price book that’s on an opportunity or quote because it will no longer be available to users. You can reactivate it later. Deactivation doesn’t affect the history of an opportunity line item. Remove the related product or price book from all opportunities and quotes. When you try to remove a product or price book that’s used on an opportunity or quote, Salesforce displays a list of the opportunities or quotes that use it. If you remove a price book, remove it from each opportunity and quote that’s listed. If you remove a product, remove it from each opportunity and quote that uses it. Then remove the price book or product. Archive the product or price book and each related price book entry. Use this option with caution. Archived products and price books can’t be recovered because they’re not stored in the Recycle Bin. Archived products and price books still appear on any opportunities or quotes that contained them before they were archived. If you archive a price book, it’s still visible in the related records but not accessible or retrievable. "

Opportunities are deals in progress. Opportunity records track details about deals, including which accounts they’re for, who the players are, and the amount of potential sales. If your Salesforce admin has set up leads in your Salesforce org, an opportunity is created when a lead is converted. Opportunities can also be created directly for accounts you’re working. Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: all editions for orgs created before Summer ’09 Available in: Essentials, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions for orgs created in Summer ’09 and later Opportunity deal change highlights help sales teams prioritize their work by calling out recent changes in deal size and close date. For example, calling out recent changes to deals can help sales managers with their weekly coaching sessions. In the opportunities list view and Kanban view, text colors and arrows indicate changes in amounts and close dates over the last seven days. And users can hover over a highlighted opportunity to get more details about the changes. As your deals progress toward the Proposal stage: Add products and attach files, such as contracts or data sheets. Log the calls you make. Use Notes to jot down things during customer meetings. Create tasks for key activities and calendar events for client meetings. Send email to the opportunity contact or other key decision-makers. During negotiation, share sales strategies with colleagues or ask your manager for targeted guidance using Chatter. As you drive your deal from one stage to the next, update the opportunity record with the current stage. And you’re closing deals in no time. Tip To learn more about using opportunities and leads, complete the Leads & Opportunities Trailhead module. Set Up Opportunities and Opportunity Products Help your sales reps close deals faster by customizing options for opportunities and the products you sell. Manage Your Opportunities Create, share, clone, and move your opportunities through your sales process. Manage the Products on Your Opportunities To help manage your deals effectively, add products to opportunities. Track Your Competitors Track competitors in a pending sale by listing the competitors’ names in the opportunity. You can enter the names of new competitors, or choose from a list of competitors defined by your administrator. To access this information, go to the Competitors related list of the opportunity.

Users at the top of the portal role hierarchy receive reminders even when they don’t have access to an opportunity. The top role in a portal hierarchy depends on how many users you set up in the hierarchy. With three roles, the top role is Partner Executive, and with two roles, the top role is Partner Manager. To prevent sending reminders to users in the Partner Executive or Partner Manager roles, remove them from the highest portal role. When you have only one role in your portal hierarchy, you can’t remove a user from the role. To stop sending reminders to an executive or other user, in your personal settings, go to My Update Reminder and change the Recipients setting to Myself only. So that your users can control which individuals receive opportunity update reminders, create at least two portal roles. "

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions In Sales Cloud, also available in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions Quote PDFs don’t support right-to-left languages. The text aligns to the left side of the page. Text formatting isn’t available in the Text/Image Field for Unicode languages such as Arabic and Japanese. To make these languages visible in plain text, contact Salesforce and ask to enable the feature for foreign character support for rich text area fields in Quote PDFs. Advanced Currency Management isn’t available with quotes. The maximum number of characters that you can use in the quotes template Text/Image Field is 32,000. This number includes the hidden HTML characters that are used to format text. Sometimes a field doesn’t appear on the quote templates palette or on a PDF that’s created from a template. If the default value for the field exceeds 255 characters, quote templates can’t include text areas or text fields. If a user can’t view or update a field because of field-level security settings, that field doesn’t appear on PDFs that are created from a template, even if the template includes that field. Read-only fields appear on PDFs. Fields that appear on a quote page layout but don’t contain data for a given quote appear on the quote templates palette but not when a PDF is created. Quote line item fields that don’t contain data don’t appear as columns in a list when a PDF is created, even if the template includes that field. For example, if no quote line items offer a discount, the Discount column doesn’t appear, even if the list includes the Discount field. If a related list isn’t included on a quote page layout, it doesn’t appear on the template palette or any PDFs for quotes that use that page layout. If the currency of a product on an opportunity differs from the user’s currency in a multicurrency org, currency fields for quotes and quote line items appear in both currencies. The product’s currency is converted to the user’s currency, and the converted amount appears in parentheses. Fields in quote custom reports appear in the report’s currency. Currency fields include Subtotal, Tax, and Grand Total . If you create a Developer or Developer Pro sandbox, templates that contain Text/Image fields can’t be opened for editing within the sandbox. Fields within sections have different alignment than columns within lists, so if you place a totals section below a list, its field values won’t align directly below the right-hand list values. For example, say your template includes a list of quote line items, including a Total Price column at the far right that shows the total for each line item. If you add a totals section beneath the list, and you include Subtotal, Total Price, and Grand Total fields, their values will show the total of all line items, but the amounts won’t align directly below the list’s Total Price column. Quote PDFs appear in both the Quote PDFs related list and the Notes & Attachments related list. See Also Create, Preview, and Activate Quote Templates "

In the left column, select an object to display its fields on the palette. Use Quick Find to easily locate items on the palette. To add an element to the template, drag it from the palette to the layout. To remove an element from the layout, drag it back to the palette, or hover over its title bar and click . For any section (including a header or footer), double-click its title bar or click to: Hide the section title. Hide field labels. (Field names appear in gray in the quote template editor, but they don’t appear on quote PDFs.) Change the number of columns (one or two). Adjust field alignment. To rename the template, click Quote Template Properties . To show field content without labels in quote template sections, headers, and footers, click , and then select the Hide checkbox. Use the Blank Space field to add vertical space anywhere on the template. Each Blank Space field adds five pixels of vertical space to the quote PDF. Note The space in the quote template preview doesn’t look the same as the space in the quote PDF. Guidelines for Using Headers and Footers A header or footer is essentially a section. You can add fields to it and show or hide its title. You can’t remove a header or footer or add more sections to it. In the quote template editor, select an object, and then drag the fields that you want to the header or footer.

Quote Template Limitations Sometimes , a field may not appear on the quote templates palette or on a PDF created from a template. Text fields can't be used on quote templates if the default value for the field exceeds 255 characters. If a user is unable to view or update a field because of field-level security settings, that field won't appear on PDFs created from a template, even if the template includes that field. Read-only fields will appear on PDFs. A field that appears on a quote page layout but does not have a value for a given quote will appear on the quote templates palette, but won't appear on PDFs created from that quote. Quote line item fields that don't contain data won't appear as columns in a list when a PDF is created, even if the template includes that field. For example, if no quote line items offer a discount, the Discount column won't appear, even if the list includes the Discount field. If a related list is not included on a quote page layout, it won't appear on the template palette or any PDFs for quotes that use that page layout. Quote PDF Limitations Text fields displayed in a related list in a quote PDF are truncated to fewer than 256 characters . This limitation occurs on rich text area fields, other types of text fields, standard fields, and custom fields. Quote PDFs do not support right-to-left languages. The text aligns to the left side of the page instead of the right. Quote PDFs do not show formatting from RTA fields. "

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions In Sales Cloud, also available in: Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions Note Your user permissions determine which tasks you can perform. See your Salesforce admin for help with any tasks that you can’t perform on your own. Relevant price books, products, and list prices must be active in an opportunity before you can create a quote for the opportunity. Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Edition orgs can activate record types and ask you to choose a Record Type when creating a quote. Record types determine the picklist values and business processes that are available when you create or edit a record. If you use divisions (Salesforce Classic only), the division of a new quote is automatically set to the division of the related opportunity. Quotes don’t support division filters. You can sort up to 200 quote lines. If your quote has more than 200 line items, sorting is done via the API. When you sort quote line items, the sort order updates in PDF quotes and in synced opportunities. When a quote is synced with an opportunity then you add a line item to the quote, the new line item is copied to the opportunity as a product in the Products related list. If an opportunity is syncing with a quote, deleting the quote line item deletes the corresponding product from the opportunity’s Products related list. Opportunity Name isn’t a required field on the quote record page layout. Custom field syncing isn’t supported. When a quote is created from the API, the quote line items aren’t created based on the opportunity line items. New opportunity line items are created based on the quote line items. If a product has default schedules, the schedules aren’t created when you add a line item to a quote. If the line item is copied from the opportunity, you can view the schedule from the opportunity. To change the schedule, edit the product record directly. If you have a quote line item with a discount, and the product has a default schedule on the product record or an individual schedule on the opportunity product record, you can’t edit the Discount field of the line item. Creating a quote via New Quote on the Quote related list copies the opportunity products to the quote line items. Custom buttons or quick actions don't automatically create quote line items.

You can activate New Order Save Behavior in Salesforce settings. In Salesforce Summer ’20 and earlier, Salesforce didn’t run custom application logic when an order product update caused a change to the parent order. For example, a new order product causing a change to the order’s total amount. Users who wanted to enforce custom applications in these scenarios required further customizations for a workaround. When New Order Save Behavior is active, Salesforce evaluates and runs these customizations whenever an order product update changes the parent order. Order and order product validation rules Order and order product Apex triggers and classes Flows, including processes We recommend that you activate New Order Save Behavior. If it isn’t activated, order field tracking doesn’t track changes on orders when order products are modified for order amounts. When you activate New Order Save Behavior, we recommend you test your custom application logic to ensure that it still works as intended. Important Packages don't support the New Order Save Behavior release update by default. Package providers can test and configure their packages to support the new behavior. If you use a package involving orders, wait for confirmation from your package provider before enabling the release update. You can install packages that support the Old Order Save Behavior on subscriber orgs that have enabled the New Order Save Behavior. However, we recommend you to verify that your package works with the new order save behavior. Starting Summer ‘21, Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing support both New Order Save Behavior and Old Order Save Behavior . Installations of Salesforce CPQ and Salesforce Billing Summer ’21 work on subscriber orgs regardless of the subscriber org’s order save behavior. If Salesforce CPQ and Billing is installed while the New Order Save Behavior release update is enabled, previous versions of Salesforce CPQ and Billing sometimes don’t work correctly. Starting Winter ‘25, the New Order Save Behavior is enabled by default in all new customer orgs. However, you can choose to disable it. Example Your order has an Apex Trigger rule that updates the custom field NeedApproval__c to True if the order amount is greater than $10,000. trigger OrderTrigger on Order (before update) { for(Order ord : Trigger.new) { if (ord.TotalAmount > 10000) { ord.NeedApproval__c = true; } } } If New Order Save Behavior is active, Salesforce runs the rule whenever you add or edit an order product on the order. If New Order Save Behavior is inactive, Salesforce runs the rule only when you insert or update the order.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Account Intelligence Views The default Account Intelligence views are My Accounts and My Important Accounts. You can edit and rename default Account Intelligence views, but you can’t share, clone, or delete them. To see a list of all accounts, switch to the Accounts list view. Custom Filters Account Intelligence views and saved filters are unique to the Account Intelligence view. They aren’t shared with the Account list view. To quickly change the list of Accounts, select a metric filter in the header row, such as With Opportunities or With Upcoming Activity. Or, use the Activity or Owner dropdown filters to temporarily change the list view. To persist your filters for a particular list in the Account Intelligence view, set them in the filter panel by selecting the Show Filters button . To further refine your list view, set additional filter criteria in the filter panel. The Activity filter shows you accounts with completed activity within the date range that you specify. To see accounts with no completed activity, select Never . Example The Acme Global account has one upcoming task. This new account doesn’t have any completed past activities. To see this account in the list of accounts in the Account Intelligence view, select Never in the Activity filter criteria Accounts Marked as Important You can see and mark accounts as important in the Account Intelligence view only. Users can mark up to 200 accounts as important. The important designation is visible only to the user who marked the accounts as important. The list of important accounts can’t be shared with other users. Opportunity Metrics The Account Intelligence view supports standard and custom number and currency fields for summarizing opportunity metrics. The default field is Amount. You can choose which opportunity field to use for metrics summaries based on the fields a Salesforce admin has configured. Set or change the summary field in the Account Intelligence view by using the available fields in the List View Controls menu. When an admin changes the default opportunity summary field for the Account Intelligence view, that action changes the default Opportunity summary field for the Pipeline Inspection view. Opportunities and Cases in the Side Panel The side panel shows up to five open opportunities and five open cases. To see a list of all related records, including closed records, click All Opportunities or All Cases . The sort order of the opportunities and cases related lists determines the sort order of the opportunities and cases shown in the side panel.

Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Business accounts available in: All Editions except Database.com Person accounts available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions Merging Duplicate Accounts: Tips and Gotchas (Salesforce Classic) General Sharing Rules In Professional, Enterprise, Unlimited, Performance, or Developer Edition orgs, sharing rules are applied to the merged account. Also, manual sharing from the primary record is applied to the merged account. Redundant Relationships If you try to merge accounts that are indirectly related to the same contact, Salesforce displays a message suggesting that you remove the redundant relationships. On account records, indirect relationships are managed from the Related Contacts related list. Related Items, Chatter Feeds, and Attachments When duplicate records are related to items such as campaigns or activities, Salesforce relates the items to the merged record, with some exceptions. Chatter feeds are retained from the primary record only. Salesforce Files attached in the Chatter feed or Files related list are retained in the merged record. Mobile Device Support You can’t use the Salesforce mobile app to merge duplicate accounts. Hidden and Read-Only Fields Salesforce retains any data in hidden or read-only fields, such as sharing settings, from the primary record. Hidden fields aren’t shown while you merge. A merged record retains the Created By user and Created Date from the oldest record merged, regardless of which record is the primary. The record shows the merge date as the Last Modified By date. Account Hierarchy In Lightning Experience, you can choose the parent account to retain. In Salesforce Classic, the merged account retains the account hierarchy from the primary record. Non-Master Accounts The non-master accounts are moved to the Recycle Bin. Divisions If divisions are enabled, the merged account is assigned to the division from the primary record unless you select otherwise. Relationship Groups Lightning Experience doesn’t support merging of accounts associated with relationship groups. Team Members Team Members from Non-Master Accounts The merged account retains all the team members from non-master accounts, even if the members are from different teams. You can only merge accounts when team members from non-master accounts have no values in unique custom fields. Before merging, either remove the unique flag from any custom fields, or clear any values from unique custom fields on the team member accounts. Permission to Merge on Teams To merge accounts to which a team member has greater record level access, you must have the Modify All Data permission on accounts. For example, suppose that you’re the account owner but an account team member has more access on one or more child account records. To merge those accounts, you need the Modify All Data permission. Person Accounts Portal Support You can’t merge person accounts that are enabled to use portal or Experience Cloud site users. Person Accounts and Business Accounts in Salesforce Classic In Salesforce Classic, if person accounts are enabled in your org, both business accounts and person accounts are returned when you search for duplicates. However, you can’t merge a person account with a business account or the opposite. Person accounts display the person account icon (). Redundant Relationships In Salesforce Classic, if you try to merge person accounts that are indirectly related to the same contact or account, Salesforce displays a message suggesting you remove the redundant relationships. Indirect relationships with accounts and indirect relationships with contacts are evaluated separately. If you have conflicts with both, you must resolve them separately. Customer-Enabled Person Accounts When merging a customer-enabled person account with a person account that isn’t customer-enabled, the customer-enabled account must be the primary record. Experience Cloud Sites Permission To merge accounts associated with sites, you must have the Manage External Users permission. You also need permissions to delete accounts and edit related records such as opportunities and contacts. Including Site-Associated Contacts in Merged Record To ensure that the merged account includes contacts associated with a site, select the account with site users as the primary record. Experience Cloud Site Type When you merge accounts that have contacts associated with a site, the contacts must belong to the same type of site. Contacts Associated with Multiple Experience Cloud Sites When you merge accounts that have contacts associated with multiple sites of the same type, a contact's access to a specific site doesn’t change. A site user's profile determines the site they can access. If two person accounts are merged and the profile for each account grants access to different sites, the resulting account can only access the primary account’s site. Partner Accounts When you merge a non-partner account with a partner account, the partner account must be selected as the primary record. When you merge a partner account with a non-partner account, the owner can’t be changed. Enterprise Territory Management If a territory was manually assigned to one of the merged accounts (for models in all states), the territory is manually added to the merged account. Account assignment rules run on the merged account for the active territory model only if you select Default for the Evaluate this account against territory rules on save checkbox on the applicable account page layout’s layout properties. If the merged value of Exclude from territory assignment rules = true , then: Territory assignment rules aren’t evaluated even if the Default checkbox for the Evaluate this account against territory rules on save checkbox is selected on the applicable account page layout’s layout properties. Existing rule-based territory associations in the active model are removed from the merged account. For territory models in non-active states (Planning or Archived ), rule-based associated territories don’t change on the merged account even if the merged account field values don’t match the rules.

Which Record Gets Relationship Group Membership The account you select as the master record retains its original relationship group memberships. For example, suppose that the master record “Joseph Blake” is a member of the “Blake Family” and “Blake Law Firm” relationship groups. “Joseph Blake” remains a member of those relationship groups. The master record replaces the non-master records in all other relationship groups involved in the merge. For example, suppose that the non-master record “Joe Blake” is a member of “Blake Trust Beneficiaries.” The master record is transferred to Joe Blake’s membership in Blake Trust Beneficiaries. If multiple non-master records belong to a relationship group that the master record doesn’t belong to, the master record acquires membership as follows: In the relationship group of the non-master account with higher priority (primary versus secondary) In the relationship group whose member record was most recently modified in the group For example, suppose that the non-master records “JR Blake” and “Joe Blake” both are members of “Acme LLP” and JR Blake is primary. The master record is transferred to JR Blake’s membership in Acme LLP. Alternatively, suppose that JR Blake and Joe Blake aren’t primary or secondary, but JR Blake’s member record in the relationship group was modified more recently. The master record is transferred to JR Blake’s membership in Acme LLP. See Also Merge Duplicate Accounts in Lightning Experience Loading "

You can’t merge person accounts that are enabled as portal or Experience Cloud site users. See Merge Duplicate Accounts . Account Quick Create On the accounts page in Salesforce Classic, fields in the Quick Create area depend on whether the default record type is set to person account or business account. Accounts Person accounts can’t be included in account hierarchies. To allow users to include person accounts in contact hierarchies, turn on the Reports To field. Person accounts can’t be parent accounts of other accounts or of contacts.

And, you can use the Reports To field to create associations between person accounts and other person accounts and contacts in a reporting structure. In Lightning Experience orgs where Shared Activities isn’t enabled, activity visibility differs for an activity associated with a person account through the Name field. In this case, the activity is visible in the person account’s Activity Timeline only. It isn’t visible in activity related lists: Open Activities and Activity History.

Person accounts can’t be enabled as users for partner Experience Cloud sites and portals because partners represent companies, not individuals. Similarly, person accounts can’t be used with Lightning External Apps Plus licenses. Person account owner power users can be configured to allow your site to accommodate the number of users or roles that are needed. Contacts When you look up a Contact in Lightning Experience, Person Account records don't appear in the Instant Results list, and in Global Search results when scoped to Contact. To receive Person Account records, scope to the Account object. Contacts to Multiple Accounts With Contacts to Multiple Accounts, a person account can be either a related contact on a business account or a related account on a contact. A person account can also be related to another person account as either a related contact or related account. Person accounts are always indirectly related to other accounts or contacts. Custom Fields Custom fields with the __pc suffix are Person Account custom fields on the Contact object. These fields aren’t supported for Einstein predictions. Custom Objects Custom objects with relationships to either accounts or contacts can be added as related lists on person accounts. Duplicate Management Duplicate rules and the Potential Duplicates component support person accounts. Email As with contacts, you can send individual emails and group emails to person accounts. In Lightning Experience, you can send list emails to person accounts from Contact list views but not Account list views. Email Integration These Salesforce email integration features support person accounts. Gmail integration Outlook integration Lightning Sync Salesforce Inbox Salesforce for Outlook Connect Offline Encryption When person accounts are enabled, encrypting some account fields encrypts the equivalent contact fields, and vice versa. See the Salesforce Shield Platform Encryption Implementation Guide . Field History Account and contact fields that appear on person account records can be tracked using the account field history settings. Person account field history is then captured in the Account History related list, the Account History report, and field audit trails. Field history for accounts tracks both business accounts and person accounts. For more information, see Track Field History for Standard Objects. Fields Most standard account and contact fields and all custom account and contact fields are available for person account page layouts. To set field-level security on a Person Account field, set security on the corresponding Contact field. The Person Account field inherits the same security setting from the Contact field. You can't specify a different security setting on a Person Account field compared to the corresponding Contact field. Person accounts don’t support certain business account fields (such as Parent Account) and some contact fields. See Account Fields . Formula Fields Custom formula fields from contacts can’t be referenced through person accounts. For more information, see Using custom formula fields with person accounts . Geocodes Geocodes for addresses can’t be added to person accounts using data integration rules. You can use a third-party service, or, if you know the geocodes for your person account records, the API can be used to add them. Icons In Salesforce Classic, person accounts have a person icon (), whereas business accounts have a folder icon (). In Lightning Experience, person accounts have a person with a building icon (), while business accounts have a building icon (). Lead Conversion In Lightning Experience, leads that don’t have a value in the Company field are converted to person accounts. Leads that do have a value in the Company field are converted to business accounts. In Salesforce Classic and the Salesforce mobile app, you can convert leads without company information to an existing business account even if person accounts are enabled. Lightning Pages To display a custom Lightning page for person accounts, create a custom account record page, then assign it to the person account record type. Suppose that an admin creates a Lightning page for accounts and assigns it as the default for an org or an app. That page becomes the org or app default for both business accounts and person accounts. List Views Person accounts appear in all but these account and contact list views. Recent Contacts on the Contacts home page in Salesforce Classic Recent Contacts on the Contacts home page in Lightning Experience Recently Viewed Contacts on the Contacts home page in Lightning Experience An admin can show which records are person accounts by adding the Is Person Account field to the list of fields to display. To include or exclude person accounts from a list view, add the Is Person Account field to the filter criteria. Marketing Cloud Engagement Person accounts are supported, but additional configuration is required. More information News Account news is available only for business accounts. Opportunity Contact Roles You can relate person accounts to opportunities using the Contact Roles related list. Packages You can include person account components and attributes in managed and unmanaged packages. If you removed Middle Name, Suffix, or Informal Name from a person account object or any person object including Contact, Lead, or User, those fields are still always available in Apex when it runs in a managed package. Page Layouts Person accounts have their own page layouts, which can include account and contact fields, account custom links, and account and contact related lists. Person accounts page layouts don’t support the Parent Account field. See Account Fields . Partners In Salesforce Classic, you can use the Partners related list to relate person accounts to each other. We recommend that you rename the Partners related list to reflect how your person accounts are connected. Process Builder Creating or editing a person account triggers Process Builder processes. Quick Actions Custom actions can be defined for Person Accounts but with some exceptions. For details, see Action Limits and Limitations. Record Types Admins can configure multiple record types for person accounts. You can change an account’s record type from a business account to a business account or from a person account to a person account. However, changing an account’s record type from a business account to a person account, or vice versa, requires using the API. Renamed Tabs and Standard Fields To customize the names of tabs and fields displayed on person account records, an admin must customize the account and contact tabs and fields. Renaming person accounts has differing effects on the entity history label between Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. In Lightning Experience, the person account history label is fixed as “Person Account History.” In Salesforce Classic, the entity history label is renamed to “[new entity name] History.” Reports To Field The Reports To field on the Person Account object allows users to associate person accounts and contacts with other person accounts and contacts in a reporting structure. Enabling this field can affect integrations, workflows, or validations that use the Reports To field on Contact. Before separating a person account into a business account and a contact, ensure that the Reports To field is empty. Person accounts can’t report to themselves or to contacts or person accounts lower in the hierarchy. Sales Dialer Users can use Sales Dialer to make and receive calls for person accounts. Sales Cloud Einstein Einstein Activity Capture can automatically log emails and events for person accounts. Other Sales Cloud Einstein features, such as Account Insights and Automated Contacts, are currently only available with business accounts and contacts. Salesforce to Salesforce Person account records can be shared using Salesforce to Salesforce. For more information, see Best Practices for Mapping Fields in Salesforce to Salesforce. Search In Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app, person accounts appear in both account and contact search results. In Salesforce Classic, person accounts appear only in account search results. To help users differentiate person accounts from business accounts in search results, admins can add the Is Person Account field to the appropriate search layout. You can configure person accounts with an account configuration in Search Manager, but you can’t configure fields that are specific to person accounts such as Email. Contact configurations don’t affect person accounts. Self-Registered Users When users self-register, admins can choose to save them as contacts under a business account or create a person account for each self-registered user. Self-Service Portal You can enable person accounts as users for a Self-Service portal. Sharing Settings If person accounts are enabled, the organization-wide default sharing must be set in one of these two ways. Contacts are set to Controlled by Parent Accounts and contacts are both set to Private Social Accounts, Contacts, and Leads As with contacts, you can link person accounts to social network profiles. Storage Person accounts count against both account and contact storage, because each person account consists of one account and one contact. Workflow Rules Creating or editing a person account triggers account workflow rules. See Also Person Accounts Person Accounts Implementation Guide "

You can use merge fields in the subject and body of custom HTML templates. When using merge fields, it’s a good idea to understand how they work and what to expect in your merged documents and emails. Business accounts available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Business accounts available in: All Editions Person accounts available in: Both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Person accounts available in Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions If your organization uses person accounts, business account and person account fields are available as account merge fields. Account fields exclusive to person accounts, such as Birthdate, Email, and Title have “Account.Person” in their merge field names. For example, {!Account.PersonBirthdate} . You can use the merge field {!Account.IsPersonAccount} to determine whether you are working with a person account or a business account. Account fields that previously had unique names and labels are no longer unique because some contact fields are displayed as part of the account object. Look for the person account icon () to identify these fields. Ensure that all custom account fields have field names and labels unique to your organization so that the merge field references the correct field. Important If two or more custom objects have matching names or labels, only one of the objects appears when you select from available merge fields. Make sure that all custom objects have unique names and labels so that you can select merge fields from any of the objects.

Business accounts available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Business accounts available in: All Editions Person accounts available in: Both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Person accounts available in Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions The list of available merge fields depends on the type of data that you’re working with. To define a validation rule that applies only to person accounts, use the IsPersonAccount merge field. For example, Account.City = “San Francisco” verifies that a business or person account’s city is San Francisco, while IsPersonAccount ( Account.City = “San Francisco”) verifies that a person account’s city is San Francisco. Handle person account and business account names separately in account validation rules. For business accounts, use the Name merge field. For person accounts, use the FirstName and LastName merge fields. Birthdate, Email , and other fields that are only supported for person accounts are available as merge fields in account validation rules. When you use one of those merge fields, business account records are processed as if those fields have blank values.

Custom Field Visibility When editing team members, users see custom fields, even if you don’t add the fields to the Add Account Team Members multiline page layout. Deleting Custom Fields If you delete a custom field, filters based on the custom field are also deleted. The results of assignment or escalation rules that rely on the custom field’s data can change. Default Values in Custom Fields If you include a default value for a custom field, the field appears blank to Lightning Experience users while they’re adding account team members. If users don’t enter a value, the default value appears on the record after they save. Custom Picklists Mass Reassign Account Teams doesn’t support custom picklists. Team Member Information Display Lookups to Team Members Not Supported You can’t create a lookup from an object, such as an account, to an account team member. Sorting in Related List The Account Team related list is sorted by Team Member Name. The sort order can’t be customized, even if you specify the sort order in the Account Team Member page layout. A user can sort the related list by any other column, but when the page is refreshed, sorting reverts to the Team Member Name column. Contact Access for Team Members If you set the organization-wide default for contacts to Controlled by Parent, users can’t see or edit the Contact Access field. Granting Access Levels to Team Members Only users with the Modify All Data profile permission can grant account team members higher access levels than the access levels of the account owner. In Lightning Experience, the running user’s permissions determine the available access level picklist values. In Salesforce Classic, an exception prevents users without the Modify All Data profile permission from saving higher access levels. Deleting Team Members A deleted account team member record isn’t moved to the Recycle Bin, and it can’t be undeleted unless the record was cascade-deleted when deleting a related account. For more information, see AccountTeamMember in the Object Reference. Validation Rules, Flows, and Apex Trigger Support Lightning Experience Support Validation rules, flows, and Apex triggers are applied when Lightning Experience users add their default team to an account using the Add action on the related list. However, they’re not applied when Lightning Experience users select the personal settings option to add their default team to accounts automatically. Salesforce Classic Support Validation rules and Apex triggers are bypassed when Salesforce Classic users add default account teams via any method. Ownership Change When an account team member is removed during an account ownership change, Apex triggers are bypassed. Visualforce Support Overriding Buttons with Visualforce Account team member records don’t support overriding the behavior of standard buttons —like Edit or Delete—with Visualforce pages.

By tracking all related accounts on a single contact record, you avoid creating duplicate contacts. Make sure your admin has set up Contacts to Multiple Accounts. If your Salesforce org uses record types, you’re sometimes prompted to choose a Record Type when creating a contact. Different record types can have different fields and picklist values. If your Salesforce org uses divisions, the division of a new contact is automatically set to the division of the related account.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: all editions Primary Account In Lightning Experience, you can merge contacts that have different primary accounts unless the contact is associated with a portal user. In Salesforce Classic, you can merge only contacts that have the same primary account. The primary account is the account listed in the Account Name field on the contact record. Data Privacy Preferences When you merge duplicate leads or contacts, you also associate a data privacy record with the primary record. If you selected the option to retain the most recently updated data privacy record for merging leads and contacts, we associate the correct record for you. Otherwise, we prompt you to select the one you want to retain for the records you merge. Redundant Relationships If you try to merge contacts that are indirectly related to the same account, Salesforce displays a message suggesting that you remove the redundant relationship. On contact records, indirect relationships are managed from the Related Accounts related list. Contact Roles When contacts are merged, contact roles on non-master contacts lose their status as the primary contact. Portal Users When you use Lightning Experience to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status isn’t shown during merging. The merged record retains the portal user status of the primary record. When you use Salesforce Classic to merge contacts associated with portal users, the portal user status is shown during merging. You choose the portal status you want to retain in the merged record. In both Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic, the primary contact must be associated with a portal user. The merged contact retains the portal user status of the primary contact. If a non-master contact is associated with a portal user, that user is deactivated. Campaigns When duplicate contacts that are members of different campaigns are merged, Salesforce retains the Member Status Updated date for each campaign the merged contact is a member of. Related Items, Chatter Feeds, and Attachments When duplicate records are related to items such as campaigns or activities, Salesforce relates the items to the merged record, with some exceptions. Chatter feeds are retained from the primary record only. Salesforce Files attached in the Chatter feed or Files related list are retained in the merged record. Hidden and Read-Only Fields Salesforce retains any data in hidden or read-only fields, such as sharing settings from the primary record. Hidden fields aren’t shown while you merge. A merged record retains the Created By user and Created Date from the oldest record merged, regardless of which record is the primary. The record shows the merge date as the Last Modified By date.

Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions You can’t restrict access to contacts beyond your organization’s default access levels. You need at least read access to the contacts and leads that you invite to an event. You need at least “Add Events” on a resource to invite it to an event. A contact that isn’t linked to an account is always private, regardless of your organization’s sharing model. Only the owner of the contact and administrators can view it. Sharing rules and workflow rules don’t apply to private contacts. If your organization uses divisions, private contacts always belong to the global division. If a recipient doesn’t have access to the account, you can’t share the contact unless you also have permission to share the account. If your organization-wide default for contacts is set to Controlled by Parent, the Contact Access options aren’t available when you share related records such as accounts. Instead, all access to contacts is determined by the user’s access to the contact’s account. If your organization-wide default for contacts is Controlled by Parent and your organization-wide default for accounts is Private, you can’t view contacts for accounts that you don’t own, even if you have the View All permission on the account object. However, if you own a contact on an account, you can view other contacts on the same account. (Access to a parent account gives you access to the associated child records.) See Also Share Contacts "

A business owner might own more than one company or a consultant might work on behalf of multiple organizations. Relate a single contact to multiple accounts so you can easily track the relationships between people and businesses without creating duplicate records. Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When you use Contacts to Multiple Accounts, each contact still requires a primary account (the account in the Account Name field). The contact and its primary account have a direct relationship. But you can add other accounts to the contact. These secondary account-contact relationships are indirect . Contacts to Multiple Accounts works with person accounts. That means a person account can be either a related contact on a business account or a related account on a contact. A person account can also be related to another person account as either a related contact or related account. When you relate a person account to an account or contact, the relationship is always indirect. That’s because person accounts don’t have primary accounts, so person accounts can’t be directly related to business accounts. And person accounts can't be primary accounts for contacts, so person accounts can't be directly related to contacts. When Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled, an Account Contact Relationship record is created for each contact with a primary account, and for each person account. Contacts to Multiple Accounts can't be enabled with the Metadata API. Tip We recommend turning on this feature outside of regular business hours to ease setup if your org has a large number of contacts. Example John Smith is president of Acme Corporations, and Acme is the account on his contact record. But John is also involved with the nonprofit media organization Greendot Media. By adding Greendot Media as a related account on John’s contact record, you can track this other relationship. John is considered a direct contact to Acme because Acme is the account on his contact record. And he’s considered an indirect contact to Greendot Media and any other accounts that he becomes related to. John also appears on the Related Contacts related list for Greendot Media and any other accounts that he’s indirectly related to.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions When a contact with a related account is created, a direct Account Contact Relationship record is also created. Similarly, when a contact gets a new primary account, the current direct Account Contact Relationship record is modified. Validation rules for the Account Contact Relationship are run immediately after the contact is saved to the database. Because the Account Contact Relationship records are created behind the scenes and users can’t access the Account Contact Relationship fields when creating or editing a contact, validation rules can block the contact from being saved. For example, the following Account Contact Relationship validation rule requires a value for the Roles field. ISNULL(Roles) However, a user can’t access the Roles field on the Account Contact Relationship object when creating or editing the contact. Therefore, the criteria in the validation rule can’t be met, and the contact can’t be saved. To bypass the validation rule when a direct Account Contact Relationship is created, add the following syntax to your Account Contact Relationship validation rule. (NOT (ISNEW() && IsDirect)) && (NOT ISCHANGED(IsDirect)) Now, the Account Contact Relationship validation rule states that the Roles field is required only if the Account Contact Relationship isn’t a direct relationship.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Contact Manager, Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions General Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled via Setup and not via the Metadata API. The account in the Account Name field on a contact record is the contact’s primary account. The relationship between the contact and its primary account is a direct relationship. All other accounts that are related to the contact are indirect relationships. Disabling Contacts to Multiple Accounts deletes all indirect account-contact relationships. Associations between a contact and its primary account remain. To remove a direct relationship between a contact and an account, change the contact’s primary account or delete the contact. Most features continue to reference a contact’s primary account. For example, duplicate management uses the primary account when comparing records. For that reason, indirect account–contact relationships can’t be included in the matching criteria used to find duplicate records. Indirect contacts aren’t available in reports run from an Account & Contact standard report type. You can import account–contact relationships with the Data Loader but not with the Data Import Wizard. In Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app, the Add to Campaign action isn’t available on items in the Related Contacts related list on account records. To see the full related list and access the Add to Campaign mass action, click View All . If the Require permission to view record names in lookup fields setting is enabled, users don’t see names of related accounts that they don’t have access to in lookup fields. To show the data, give users read access to the record or the View All Lookup Record Names permission. See Require Permission to View Record Names in Lookup Fields . You can create Experience Cloud site users from Contacts to Multiple Accounts. To grant access to their records, configure a sharing set. Account Contact Relationships All direct contacts appear in the account record’s Related Contacts related list. But it’s possible that your admin removed the Contacts related list from your page layouts. When you have access to a particular account, the related contacts that you have Read access to appear in the Related Contacts related lists. When you have access to a particular contact, all related accounts appear in the Related Accounts related list. You can open the ones to which you have Read access. When creating indirect relationships between accounts and contacts, the contact must have a primary account—it can’t be a private contact. You can’t create a contact from the Account Contact Relationship detail page. Changing a contact’s primary account can trigger a workflow rule that changes the primary account to something else. In that event, Salesforce saves the relationship between the contact and the account you selected as an indirect relationship. Your admin controls the settings for saving previous relationships. Some lists of most recently used items (such as a contact lookup field) only show direct relationships. When you remove indirect relationships, they’re deleted and can’t be restored from the Recycle Bin. If you delete a direct relationship, indirect relationships are removed. In this case, if the direct relationship is restored, the indirect relationship is also restored. When Contacts to Multiple Accounts is enabled, an Account Contact Relationship record is created for each contact with a primary account, and for each person account. Merging If you try to merge contacts that are indirectly related to the same account, an error message instructs you to remove the duplicate relationship. The same is true when merging accounts that are indirectly related to the same contact. The error message includes which account–contact relationships prevent the merge, regardless of whether you have access to the records. Without access to a record, you can’t navigate to it. When merging person accounts, indirect relationships with accounts and indirect relationships with contacts are evaluated separately. If you have conflicts with both, resolve the two errors separately. Microsoft Integration When syncing contacts between Salesforce and Microsoft Outlook, only the primary account relationship is synced. If you remove the account name from a contact in Outlook, the contact can’t sync to Salesforce if the contact has relationships to other accounts. Admin Settings What happens when you attempt to delete an account that includes direct contacts related to other accounts depends on what your admin has specified. You’re either blocked from deleting the account or allowed to delete the account. Deleting the account also deletes the account’s direct contacts, regardless of whether they have relationships to other accounts. When you change a contact’s primary account, Salesforce either deletes the previous account, or saves it as an indirect relationship. Your admin’s settings determine what happens to the previous account. Whether activities roll up to a contact’s parent account depends on what your admin specified in the activity settings. Account Contact Relationship Object The following custom field types aren’t supported. Lookup relationship Master-detail relationship Roll-up summary Text area (long) Text area (rich) The following features and customizations aren’t supported. Field history Field sets Approvals Record types Field label renaming Custom actions are supported, but with limitations. Custom actions must be specific to the Account Contact Relationship object. Global actions aren’t supported. You can create actions that update records or invoke Lightning components or Visualforce pages. However, you can’t create actions that create records. You can’t create actions that send emails or log calls because the Account Contact Relationship object can’t have activities related to it. You can’t override the default actions on the Account Contact Relationship object. Only custom actions that are created on the Contact object can use the Account Contact Relationship object as a target object. Chatter standard actions aren’t supported because the Account Contact Relationship object doesn’t have a Chatter feed.

To add and edit opportunity contact roles, users must have read access to the Account Name field on the Contact object. To view the contact records in the Opportunity Contact Role related list, you must have the proper user permissions and sharing access to those records. A single contact or person account can have a different opportunity contact role on multiple records. In Salesforce Classic, if a contact has multiple opportunity contact roles on one opportunity, the Opportunities related list on the Contact record shows duplicates. In Lightning Experience, the related list doesn’t show duplicates. When contacts are merged, opportunity contact roles on non-master contacts lose their status as the primary contact. If you have an opportunity with the same opportunity contact roles for multiple contacts, and the contacts are merged, the opportunity contact roles aren’t merged. After the contacts merge, the original opportunity contact role records still exist. The opportunity contact roles have the same contact, opportunity, and role. For example, let’s say your opportunity had three Decision Maker opportunity contact roles, but each one was a different contact. The three contacts merged into one contact, but your opportunity still has the same three contacts with the same opportunity contact roles. When you delete and later undelete an opportunity or contact, the opportunity contact role is also undeleted. Opportunity contact roles can’t be undeleted independently. When an opportunity or contact is undeleted, the related opportunity contact roles don’t keep their primary status. Inserting and updating multiple opportunity contact roles at one time works differently in Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience. In Salesforce Classic, each record is inserted or updated individually. If you use triggers that execute when you insert or delete multiple opportunity contact roles, a separate trigger executes for each record. In Lightning Experience, all of the records are inserted or updated together. If your triggers execute when you insert or update multiple contact roles, one trigger executes for all of the records in a bulk transaction. When you create multiple opportunity contact roles by inserting multiple opportunities with the ContactId field populated, Salesforce creates each contact role in an individual transaction. A separate trigger executes for each contact role record. "

Your Reps’ Goal What to Expect from Salesforce Maps Lite Plot records on the map It determines record locations using coordinates in latitude and longitude fields. Those fields differ depending on the kinds of records that your reps plot. Specifically: Accounts require Billing Latitude and Billing Longitude fields. Contacts require Mailing Latitude and Mailing Longitude fields. Leads require Latitude and Longitude fields. That way, the map can: Show up to 50 records at a time, providing they include accurate addresses. Include pagination that lets reps access other records in batches of 50 or fewer. But for your reps to plot records without latitude and longitude coordinates, Salesforce Maps Lite generates coordinates for them. Generated coordinates last for just that session in Salesforce Maps Lite. Work with records in bulk It includes a list of the records that correspond with the record markers that appear on the map. The list: Shows up to 50 records simultaneously. Provides up to 15 fields for each record based on the fields that appear in the object’s list views. Lets reps locate a specific record marker on the map when they select its corresponding record from the list. Indicates which records don’t appear on the map because they require address corrections. Perform actions on individual records It includes functions directly in record markers on the map. When your reps select record markers: The same fields appear as the ones in the list of records. Clustered with other nearby markers relative to their zoomed view, reps can navigate them using pagination functions or show the cluster of records in a list. "

Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud and Government Cloud Plus for an additional cost in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Note The Analytics Apps and Template functionality included as a part of CRM Analytics is available in English only. Requirements to Install Revenue Insights Enable data sync or direct data. Your org needs at least one record of each of these objects: Account, Opportunity, User, UserRole, Task, and Events. Role hierarchy must be set up with at least two layers. For example, you have one Sales Manager and one Sales Rep. Note Even if you use Territory hierarchy, you must have set up a role hierarchy. Requirements to Include Forecast Data Forecast data comes from Salesforce Forecasting, a feature of Sales Cloud. When you set up forecasting, you create and activate a forecast type. You must have an active forecast type that matches one of the following: OBJECT MEASURE* DATA TYPE HIERARCHY Opportunity Currency CloseDate (standard) Role hierarchy Opportunity Splits Currency CloseDate (standard) Role hierarchy Opportunity Currency CloseDate (standard) Territory hierarchy Note *Revenue Insights supports the standard Amount field or a custom field of type Currency. For a role hierarchy-based forecast, go to Setup > Forecast Hierarchy and assign forecast managers to at least two layers. For a territory hierarchy-based forecast, go to Setup > Sales > Territories > Territory Models and assign forecast managers to at least two layers. Go to Forecasts > Quota and load at least one quota value for your forecast type. If your forecast type is based on the Opportunity Splits object, you must have at least one Opportunity Split record. The measure you use in your forecast type must have historical trending enabled on the opportunity object. If you use an opportunity split, ensure that the associated roll-up field on the opportunity object is trended. Requirements to Include Forecast and Quota Data Quota data comes from Salesforce Forecasting, a feature of Sales Cloud. Or, you can upload quota data from a CSV file, which allows you to use quota data stored outside of Salesforce. If you use Salesforce Forecasting, see the notes in Requirements to Add Forecast Data. To use a CSV file: Create a CSV file with your quota data and save it. Then, navigate to the CRMA Analytics Studio > quota dataset. Edit the dataset by uploading your CSV file, which replaces the default quota dataset. Refresh the app to ensure the recipe runs again and pulls in your quota data. Requirements and Considerations to use Forecast Insights Dashboards Forecast Insights dashboards are populated from Salesforce Forecasting, a feature of Sales Cloud. Forecasts must be enabled and configured to use Forecast Insights. Territory forecasts are not supported. Opportunity split-based forecasts are not supported. After Installing Revenue Insights After installing Revenue Insights, navigate to App Launcher > Data Manager and follow steps to schedule data sync and recipes. Note When you turn on CRM Analytics for your org, a default Analytics Integration User is created. This ""user"" accesses the data within Salesforce when the recipe is used to bring data in as datasets to CRM Analytics. It's important that this user has the proper level of permissions to access your data. For example, the integration user needs have object level access to all the objects from which data you want to pull, and field level access to the fields within those objects. If you have trouble in creating your app or can’t view data, you sometimes need to modify either object or field permissions to allow the integration user to access them.

You can add Revenue Insights to your navigation bar or edit your permission settings depending on configuration settings. Lastly, you can add additional filters to your panels. Schedule the App You can set or change the app schedule or refresh the data as needed on the app management tab. For more information, see Change Your Intelligent App Settings . Select a time outside normal work hours so the data refresh doesn’t interrupt business activities. The app now syncs and runs the recipes in the correct order every day at the time you set. Add Revenue Insights to your Navigation Bar To make it easy to view your insights, add the Revenue Insights App to your Navigation Bar. From the Sales App, click the pencil icon. From the Edit Sales App Navigation Items select Add More Items . From the Available Items column, click All . In the Search field, enter Revenue Insights . Select Revenue Insights, and click Add 1 Nav Item and click Save . Verify Your Permission Settings When you turn on CRM Analytics for your org, a default Analytics Integration User is created. This ""user"" accesses the data within Salesforce when the recipe is used to bring data in as datasets to CRM Analytics. It's important that this user has the proper level of permissions to read the data you're trying to pull from the org to CRM Analytics. For example, the integration user must have object-level access to all the objects from which data you want to pull. And you need field level access to the fields within those objects. If you have trouble in creating your app or can’t view data, modify either object or field permissions. You must allow the integration user profile to have read access them. Add Additional Filters to Your Dashboards You can add additional filters to the Sales Performance dashboard. This dashboard has a Compare by selection as well as five global filters by default. You can add additional filters to the Overview dashboard. To add an additional global filter in the filter row of the Sales Performance dashboard: From the Sales Performance dashboard, select Edit in the upper right-hand corner. Click in the panel that displays the five global filters. On the panel on the right, select Manage Global Filters . Click Add a Global Filter. From the menu, select the Opportunity RevInsights dataset. Select the field you want to add. For example, you can select Industry. Choose the field you want like to add and click Create . By default, the filter panel shows five filters in one row. Edit the number of filters displayed to view your new filter in the row of default filters. Click in the filters panel again to open the right side panel. You can see that the Filters per Row field is set to 5. On the side panel change the Filters Per Row to 6. To view the changes, click Preview . Click Save if you’re satisfied with the changes. To add another option to the Compare by filter of the Sales Performance dashboard: From the Sales Performance dashboard, select Edit in the upper right-hand corner. Click in the Compare by field. On the panel on the right, select Advanced Editor . The widget JSON code displays. To show the query code, select Query . Copy and paste the last code snippet that looks like the following: { ""Display"": ""Opportunity Owner"", ""Field"": ""'User.UniqueUserName'"", ""projection"": "", closed['User.UniqueUserName'] as 'User.UniqueUserName'"", ""saqlField"": "", 'User.UniqueUserName'"" } To use the compare by field you want to add, edit the code snippet. For example { ""Display"": ""Industry"", ""Field"": ""'Account.Industry'"", ""projection"": "", closed['Account.Industry'] as 'Account.Industry'"", ""saqlField"": "", 'Account.Industry'"" } Note Only fields from the Opportunity RevInsights dataset can be added as options. Save your changes. To add a filter to the Overview dashboard: Note The Overview page combines multiple datasets and live queries. The challenge of adding a filter here means that the field-selected needs to apply to all of the data sources. For example, you want to add a Region filter, such as Billing Country, to the dashboard. This field is in the Opportunity RevInsights dataset so most of the widgets on Overview will facet automatically by default. However, the SOQL queries look at the ForecastingItem object. This object doesn’t have a way to filter by country because the forecast is done at the individual person level. Drag a list filter to the desired location on the dashboard. Note Don’t select global filters. Select the dataset that includes your field. Salesforce recommends you use the Opportunity RevInsights dataset because most queries on the dashboard use this dataset. Select a field and configure the design. Open up the dataset connections and add a connection for your field, if applicable. Most queries on Overview, Team Performance, and Sales Performance tabs can facet based on these steps. The top section on the Overview dashboard, including the Team Quota Attainment, KPIs, as well as the forecasting chart may not facet. The faceting doesn’t happen because there are live queries based on Forecasting Item. The dashboard uses the following datasets: Opportunity RevInsights UserRole OpptyProduct Activity OpportunityHistory Forecasting Quota Modify queries beginning with soql_ . If there’s a field that can be found in the ForecastingItem object and is pulled in for the Revenue Insights app, in addition to adding dataset connections, the soql queries require an additional binding. The following shows the default query for soql_user_closed_won: ""query"": ""SELECT SUM(ForecastAmount) ForecastAmount FROM ForecastingItem {{toArray( toArray(\""Owner.UserRoleId\"", \""IN\"", row(intermediate_step.result, [0], [\""UserRoleId\""])), toArray(\""ForecastingTypeId\"", \""IN\"", row(forecasting_type.selection, [0], [\""ForecastingTypeId\""])), toArray(\""OwnerId\"", \""IN\"", row(intermediate_step.result, [0], [\""Id\""])), toArray(\""Period.StartDate\"", \""BETWEEN\"", row(CloseDate_1.selection, [0], [\""min\"", \""max\""]))).asSQLWhere(\""sobject\"", true)}} AND ForecastingItemCategory = 'ClosedOnly'"", If an additional field is added, use an additional binding: ""query"": ""SELECT SUM(ForecastAmount) ForecastAmount FROM ForecastingItem {{toArray( toArray(\""Owner.UserRoleId\"", \""IN\"", row(intermediate_step.result, [0], [\""UserRoleId\""])), toArray(\""ForecastingTypeId\"", \""IN\"", row(forecasting_type.selection, [0], [\""ForecastingTypeId\""])), toArray(\""OwnerId\"", \""IN\"", row(intermediate_step.result, [0], [\""Id\""])), toArray(\""Period.StartDate\"", \""BETWEEN\"", row(CloseDate_1.selection, [0], [\""min\"", \""max\""]))).asSQLWhere(\""sobject\"", true), toArray(\""NewField\"", \""IN\"", row(listfilter_name.selection, [0], [\""FieldName_in_listfilter\""]))}} AND ForecastingItemCategory = 'ClosedOnly'"", Create Other Versions of Revenue Insights After the initial instance of Revenue Insights is auto-created, you can create other versions via Analytics Studio so that your team members can use the version that meets their needs. You can create as many versions as you need. When your team members go to view the dashboard from the Revenue Insights tab, they can select the appropriate instance of Revenue Insights depending on their forecast type. Note While you can create as many Revenue Insights versions as you like, recipe and data sync limits apply. To create other versions of Revenue Insights: From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Revenue Insights , and then select Revenue Insights Setup . From Revenue Insights Setup, you can see details about your auto-installed app and a link to Analytics Studio. To create more versions of Revenue Insights, click the link to Analytics Studio . In Analytics Studio, click Create in the upper right corner. To open the template picker, select App , then Create App from Template . Locate the Revenue Insights tile, select it, and click Continue . Review the app preview page, and click Continue to open the configuration wizard. If you’re offered a choice of basing your app on an existing app or creating a one, select Create a brand new app and click Continue . The app runs a compatibility check against your org to ensure it includes the data to successfully create the app’s datasets, recipes, and dashboards.

You may not have configured data sync, you may have the wrong objects or custom objects. You may have Org configurations that are incompatible with the requirements of the app. The following sections can help you troubleshoot these common issues. Understand Enablement Steps Revenue Insights dashboards are created by CRM Analytics with the following flow: The Enablement Wizard runs. Placeholder datasets and dashboards are created. Recipes are generated. Extended metadata is applied to the populated datasets. If the recipe fails, the app creation process will not complete successfully. The impact of this may manifest as dashboard errors, format issues in displayed data, or other unexpected behavior Failure due to field availability or Org configuration If the recipe failure can be corrected by changing the Org configuration (for example, field availability, user roles , or running replication recipes), complete the following steps: Correct the org configuration. Manually start the recipe through the Data Manager. Once the recipe completes, click Reset in the App. Do not change any of the options in the wizard, and complete the reset process. Upon completion of the reset, the app creation succeeds. Failure due to Data Sync When Data Sync is enabled for CRM Analytics, the creation of new Apps may fail during recipe execution due to the fact that objects or fields referenced in the apps have not yet been created successfully in a connected dataset via Data Sync. Failures can also occur when there is a new version of the CRM Analytics App that includes additional default fields. If your app fails due to data sync issues, complete the following steps: After the app failure, go to Data Manager > Connect , and run Data Sync for any SFDC Local connections. Open the App folder for the failed app and click the Reset button. Do not change any of the options in the wizard. Complete the reset process. Failure due to App Configuration The recipe can fail if a part of the configuration is incorrect. For example, the recipe could include a field reference whereas your Org contains custom references. Or, the recipe may require you have Forecasting enabled, and you do not have it enabled. To verify that this might be an issue review the Considerations section before enabling your app. If you can correct the issue by changing an answer or selection in the wizard, perform one of the following actions: Delete the App and create an entirely new version of the App. Reset the App and choose different answers, as appropriate.

Einstein Account Management is powered by CRM Analytics, so you must enable CRM Analytics. Einstein Account Management requires you to have Customer Insights version 1.5 or higher enabled and configured. By default, the auto-installed version is prioritized during setup. If multiple versions of Customer Insights have been created, Einstein Account Management uses the most recently installed compatible version. Einstein Account Management uses the same security predicate as your Customer Insights app. If you selected a custom security predicate from the wizard, it inherits this selection Einstein Account Management uses the same field as your Customer Insights app to track the total amount of the opportunity. By default the amount field is used. To create the default Einstein Discovery Account Health model, you must have 400 unique accounts that experienced a change in win rate between two specified time periods: 12-6 months ago, and 6 months ago to present. If you don’t yet have enough data, the Einstein Discovery models can’t be created initially. In this case, the app is created without Einstein Discovery models. You can go back later and recreate the app when you later have enough data. For more information about Einstein Discovery specified limits, see Einstein Discovery Limits . To create the default Einstein Discovery Account Upside model, you need at least 400 unique accounts that experienced a change in product count or quantity between two specified time periods. For more information about Einstein Discovery specified limits, see Einstein Discovery Limits . Salesforce recommends that you schedule the Einstein Account Management recipe to run on a regular cadence that is scheduled within 24 hours of your Customer Insights recipes. Note these requirements for using Einstein Account Management: Note When you turn on CRM Analytics for your org, a default Analytics Integration User is created. This ""user"" accesses the data within Salesforce when the recipe is used to bring data in as datasets to CRM Analytics. It's important that this user has the proper level of permissions to access your data. For example, the integration user needs have object level access to all the objects from which data you want to pull, and field level access to the fields within those objects. If you have trouble in creating your app or can’t view data, you sometimes must modify either object or field permissions to allow the integration user to access them. Recipes, ED Models, Components, and Datasets The Einstein Account Management Accounts Recipe is used in Einstein Account Management: This recipe pulls in Account information and adds multiple aggregated metrics across Opportunities, Tasks, Events, Products, and LineItems. The Account Health and Account Upside ED Models are created. In addition, the Account Inspector with Predictions component is created. Einstein Account Management uses all the datasets created by Customer Insights. In addition, the Einstein Account Management - Accounts dataset is created: Dataset Name Contents Source Used by Security Predicate Special Requirements Einstein Account Management- Accounts Aggregated data about accounts Salesforce object -> Recipe All dashboards The security predicate is inherited from Customer Insights. By default the predicate is: 'Owner.Role.Roles' == ""$User.UserRoleId"" || 'OwnerId' == ""$User.Id"" None. Loading "

Einstein Features and Insights in Pipeline Inspection To show the Opportunity Score field, enable Einstein Opportunity Scoring. Opportunity scores are shown in tiers instead of numerical values. Einstein Deal Insights includes insights based on Einstein Opportunity Scoring. To show these insights, first enable Einstein Opportunity Scoring. These insights are available only in Pipeline Inspection. To get more activity-based insights in Einstein Deal Insights, we recommend setting up Einstein Activity Capture. To get more email-based insights in Einstein Deal Insights, set up Einstein Activity Capture and Einstein Email Insights. To get insights based on call recordings in Einstein Deal Insights, set up Einstein Conversation Insights. To get insights about service cases, use cases. Insights are shown about service cases for the opportunity’s associated accounts, contacts, or products. If you use the Product field on cases, you get more data. The Product field is available only if entitlements are set up to include products. To allow users to add contacts to cadences from deal insights and opportunities, add the Add to Cadence action to the opportunity record layout. Your company must have a Sales Engagement (High Velocity Sales) license, and users need Sales Engagement (High Velocity Sales) permissions. Filters Users can filter by opportunity owner, opportunity teams, or territories. Managers can see deals for users who have subordinate roles in the role hierarchy, where the user is either the opportunity owner or on the opportunity team. Users with View All permission on opportunities can search for any user and see opportunities owned by that user and other users with subordinate roles in the role hierarchy. To see deals where reports are on the opportunity team, users must be in the same branch of the role hierarchy. Flow Chart To enable the Pipeline Inspection flow chart, you must have the Revenue Intelligence add-on license. To access the Pipeline Inspection flow chart, users must be assigned a Revenue Intelligence permission set. The flow chart is the corresponding chart where you view the forecast category metrics. If you turn on the flow chart but don't enable the forecast category metrics, your users don’t see the flow chart. To get data in the flow chart, make sure historical trending is enabled for opportunities. Waterfall Chart When pipeline changes metrics are enabled, a waterfall chart is shown to users on the Chart tab. To get data in the waterfall chart, make sure historical trending is enabled for opportunities. Historical Trending When you turn on Pipeline Inspection, historical trending is enabled for opportunities if it’s not already enabled. Five fields are set up for tracking by default: Amount, Close Date, Forecast Category, Probability, and Stage. You can enable 3 more fields for a total of 8 fields. The Next Step field is automatically set up in historical trending when you enable Pipeline Inspection and uses one of the allocated opportunity fields. Historical trending must be enabled to: View opportunity changes and insights when you hover over the Amount, Change, Close Date, Forecast Category, and Stage fields and your custom currency and number fields. Changes are indicated for open and in progress deals only. Show the New, Won, Increased, Moved In, Moved Out, Decreased, and Lost metrics in the pipeline changes metrics grouping, and the corresponding lists of opportunities. Show the Change field on opportunities when filtering the list by the Increased or Decreased metrics in the pipeline changes metrics grouping. Get details of the last update when the Next Step field hasn’t been updated in 7 days or more. View data in the flow or waterfall charts. Although you can use the Expected Revenue and Quantity fields as summary fields, they aren’t available in historical trending. If you use these fields as summary fields, some metrics or charts don’t show data. After the Next Step field is enabled in historical trending, it takes at least 7 days to collect historical data before you see the last update details. If you make configuration changes in historical trending, such as adding filters, some records don’t show opportunity changes and insights. The opportunity amounts can also be excluded from metric calculations and charts. If historical trending was enabled for opportunities before you enable Pipeline Inspection, your historical trending configuration doesn’t change. When you enable Historical Trending in Pipeline Inspection, 3 months of historical data plus the current month is copied to the historical trending table, and the data is stored for 12 months. If you've used opportunities more than 3 months before the month you enable historical trending, your pipeline inspection metrics show data only for the past 3 months and the current month. Field history for custom number or currency fields is tracked starting on the day that you enable them in Historical Trending. Pipeline Metrics and Fields Pipeline Inspection supports number and currency fields, both standard and custom, for summarizing pipeline metrics. Amount is the default field. Based on the fields that an admin configured, users can set or change the summary field in their pipeline views using the available fields in the List View Controls menu. Formula fields can’t be used as summary fields. You can rename the forecast category metrics that display in the Pipeline Inspection view. All the links to rename forecast category metrics are accessible from the Pipeline Inspection Setup page. If you select single category rollups , rename forecast categories in Object Manager. If you select cumulative forecast rollups , rename forecast categories directly on the Setup page. To edit what appears in other languages for both settings, go to the Pipeline Inspection Metric Configuration page in Translation Workbench. The Pipeline Changes metrics show a Change field in the opportunity list when users filter the view by the Increased and Decreased metrics. The Change field is excluded from the limit of 15 fields users can display in the Pipeline view. You can’t show custom rich text area fields in the opportunity list in Pipeline Inspection. You can’t rename the pipeline changes metrics. Push Count Field The Push Count field is enabled by default in Pipeline Inspection and opportunities. To control visibility of the field, go to Opportunity Settings in Setup. To see the Push Count field in the Opportunity list in Pipeline Inspection, users must add it. To show it in the list, go to the List View Controls menu under the gear icon, and choose Select Fields to Display . You can’t add the Push Count field to opportunity record layouts. Top Contacts and Users Involved in Deals To show in the side panel who’s involved in opportunities, enable Activity 360 Reporting in Einstein Activity Capture settings.

You can select from amount, currency, or number fields to summarize metrics in Pipeline Inspection and the flow chart, based on what your Salesforce admin configured. For example, use a currency field to see data for annual recurring revenue, or use a number field to view product quantities. The forecast categories are defined by Salesforce, and sometimes they don’t correspond precisely to the labels of the forecast categories that you use. Your admin can customize the labels. Waterfall Chart The waterfall chart shows changes in pipeline categories such as opportunities created, increases and decreases in your pipeline, and won and lost amounts. It also shows amounts for opportunities moved in and out of the period. You specify the opportunities to view using the quick filters for close date and user and then the time period to show. The chart data shows the net change to the pipeline over the selected period. The fields used to summarize your data are the same as the fields used for the flow chart and are based on the fields your admin configured. The metrics names, such as New, Increased, and Won, in the pipeline changes metrics group shown in the waterfall chart are specified by Salesforce and can’t be changed. Note The charts don’t support Expected Revenue and Quantity as summary fields. See Also Revenue Intelligence Revenue Insights Set or Change the Summary Field for Pipeline Inspection Metrics "

After this feature is retired, users will no longer see predictions in Pipeline Inspection when opportunities are unlikely to close in the current month. For more information, see Close Date Predictions Retirement . Predictions About Close Dates Predict which opportunities with close dates in the current month are unlikely to be won within the same month. Close date predictions were originally referred to as Einstein Deal Insights. The Model Einstein analyzes your team’s past closed opportunities, both won and lost, and deploys a model tailored to the selling patterns of your company. Einstein considers many positive and negative factors, including: Each opportunity’s record details (both standard and custom fields), opportunity history, and related activities. The related account’s record details and some record history. These factors are based on your CRM data and accurately contribute to the prediction. Once a month, Einstein analyzes the opportunity data and refreshes the model. Opportunities are continuously reassessed, and insights are added or removed every few hours. To help Einstein learn quickly, be sure to keep your standard opportunity data, such as close dates and stages, updated as your deals progress through their lifecycle. When Predictions About Close Dates Don’t Appear Close date predictions sometimes don’t appear for any of these reasons. Close date predictions were recently enabled. It can take around 48 hours before insights are available. The opportunity’s close date is set outside of the current month. The close date was moved out of the current month into a future month. The opportunity is closed, so insights are removed. Insights from Einstein Opportunity Scoring Surface insights about deal progression and sales activities. To get the most out of these insights, connect your email, calendar, events, and contacts using Einstein Activity Capture. The Model Einstein analyzes patterns in your data to build a data model. The criteria include: Standard opportunity fields, opportunity record history, tasks, and activities. Automatically synced email and calendar data (if Einstein Activity Capture is enabled). Note These insights related to Einstein Opportunity Scoring are separate from the Einstein Opportunity Insights feature of Sales Cloud Einstein. Insights appear in Pipeline Inspection if the Einstein Opportunity Scoring model determines that they’re influential in the deal’s likelihood to close. The insights can be positive or negative factors. Einstein analyzes the opportunity data weekly and refreshes the model. Then, the model is used multiple times daily to generate new insights. When Insights from Einstein Opportunity Scoring Don’t Appear Insights from Einstein Opportunity Scoring sometimes don’t appear for any of these reasons. An insight that’s generated isn’t one of the top supporting factors for the opportunity score. Not enough activity data. Either Einstein Activity Capture isn’t set up, or not enough activity data is associated with the opportunity. The opportunity is closed, so insights are removed. Insights About Service Cases Show insights about service cases that can affect the progress of an opportunity. The Model When the Pipeline Inspection side panel is opened, Salesforce checks for cases related to the opportunity. If service cases are found, insights are shown. Insight criteria include: Cases for opportunity contacts, products, and the opportunity’s account. Related cases within the last 30 days. When Insights About Service Cases Don’t Appear Insights about service cases sometimes don’t appear for any of these reasons. You don’t use cases. No cases exist in the last 30 days for an opportunity contact, opportunity product, or an opportunity’s account. The opportunity is closed, so insights are removed.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Available with Revenue Intelligence, which is available for an additional cost in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions Ensuring Sales Rep Accountability with Pipeline Inspection (English Only) Filtering If a search returns 2,000 or more records, a total for the selected metric isn’t shown. The Moved Out metric looks at opportunities with close dates within 6 months after the selected period to determine whether those deals meet the Moved Out criteria. The searched records count toward the record limit. Even if the maximum record limit is reached for any of the pipeline metrics, and the total for the metric isn’t shown, the list still shows records. When filtering by a pipeline metric, the list sometimes shows fewer than the maximum opportunities even when the actual number of matching opportunities is more than the maximum. The All Opportunities owner filter isn’t supported. You can filter by opportunity owner, opportunity teams, or territories. To filter by any user’s opportunities, make sure you have View All permission on opportunities. Managers can see deals for users who have subordinate roles in the role hierarchy, where the user is either the opportunity owner or on the opportunity team. Managers can also see deals for users with subordinate portal roles. To see opportunities where your reports are on the opportunity team, make sure the manager and the opportunity team members are in the same branch of the role hierarchy. If you don't use a role hierarchy, add the opportunity team members to the Opportunity Team related list. Filter logic is supported for the AND, NOT, and OR operators. Pipeline Views and Custom Filters The default pipeline views are My Pipeline and My Important Opportunities. You can’t share, clone, or delete default pipeline views. To create or edit public pipeline views, users must have the Manage Public List Views permission. Other users can only create private views. Pipeline views are created with fields that users have permission to view. When users gain access to fields they didn't previously have access to, they can manually add the fields to their private views. Users with the Manage Public List Views permission can add the fields to public views. Pipeline views and saved filters aren’t shared between Pipeline Inspection and Opportunity list views. To create and edit all types of list views, users must have the Create and Customize List Views permission. When a user is saved in the Owner filter, you can't update the sharing settings for a pipeline view. Opportunity Changes The Amount field highlights changes only when the currency is the same for the before and changed-to values. The value in the Recent Activity field is the difference, in days, between the current day and a past activity. The value in this field can also represent the number of days between the current day and an upcoming activity. New tasks created on opportunities don’t appear in the Recent Activity field in Pipeline Inspection until they’re completed. New calls and events show at the time they’re created, regardless of their status. The Stage and Forecast Category changes shown in red and green text with arrows indicate stages or categories that are advancing or reverting. The progression of stages follows the order set by your Salesforce admin when they selected the picklist values for opportunity stages and mapped them to forecast categories. Opportunities Marked as Important Users can mark up to 200 opportunities as important. Important opportunities are visible only to the user who marked them and can’t be shared with other users. You can see and mark opportunities as important in Pipeline Inspection only. Inline Editing Not all fields in the list view can be inline edited. Editable fields have a pencil when you hover over the field. Non-editable cells have a lock . When making inline edits, required fields can’t be left blank. You can edit the following field types inline in Pipeline Inspection: Checkbox, Currency, Date, Email, External Lookup, Lookup, Number, Percent, Picklist, Multi-Select Picklist, Phone, Text, and URL. These opportunity fields are also editable inline: Amount (on opportunities without products), Close Date, Quantity, and Stage. Stage is editable inline only when no other validations or dependent fields have been added. You can’t edit the Forecast Category and Probability fields, because these fields are updated when the Stage field is edited. Although you can edit dependent picklist fields in Opportunity list views, they aren’t editable inline in Pipeline Inspection. You can edit opportunities of multiple record types inline in the same list view. Activity Timeline in Side Panel The filter selections must be set each time you view an opportunity. In the Upcoming Activity section, only one open activity is shown, and its due date must be within 6 months from the current date. Open tasks that don’t have a due date aren’t included. Open tasks that are overdue are included. Deal Insights in Side Panel To view deal insights in the side panel, you must have at least one of these features enabled in your org: Einstein Conversation Insights, Einstein Deal Insights (in Pipeline Inspection), Einstein Email Insights, or Einstein Opportunity Scoring. When a required feature is enabled and a user has access, a side panel icon appears next to the opportunity name in the list. Clicking the icon opens a side panel that shows the opportunity metrics and insights on the Insights tab. If a user doesn’t have access to the required features, the icon that opens the panel to view the deal insights is hidden. Einstein Activity Capture, Einstein Conversation Insights, Einstein Deal Insights, Einstein Email Insights, Einstein Opportunity Scoring, and service cases supply the insights shown on the Insights tab. Activity-related insights include manually entered activities, and activities logged in Einstein Activity Capture. You can add contacts to a cadence from some Deal Insights. The limit that you can add is 20 contacts at a time, rather than 200 for the other objects supported by cadences. Top Contacts and Users Involved in Deals You can see up to three external contacts (people whose email address isn’t from your company), and two internal users (people whose email address is from your company). An admin must configure this feature. Contacts or users related to an opportunity who have no activity in the past seven or 30 days don’t show in the side panel. Pipeline Inspection Metrics The pipeline changes metrics include a Change field in the opportunity list that shows only when you filter by Increased or Decreased. The Push Count field tracks the number of times a close date is pushed out past a calendar month only. It doesn’t track close dates pushed out within the same calendar month. The total number of pushes doesn’t decrease when an opportunity’s close date is pulled in by a calendar month. The Push Count field isn’t shown in the list of opportunities in Pipeline Inspection by default. To show this field, click the gear icon and select the Select Fields to Display option. The available fields for summarizing pipeline metrics are Amount, Quantity, Expected Revenue, and custom currency and number fields. Formula fields can’t be used as summary fields. When you use Quantity or Expected Revenue as summary fields, some data doesn’t show in the pipeline metrics group and charts. Charts If the summary values are negative or zero, the charts don't show data. If a search returns 2,000 or more opportunity records, the charts don't show data.

The fields in the Pipeline Inspection opportunity list give more detailed information about the opportunities in the pipeline. Available in: Lightning Experience Available with Sales Cloud in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions Available with Revenue Intelligence, which is available for an additional cost in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions Pipeline Inspection Metrics Users can choose from two groups of metrics in Pipeline Inspection to view their pipelines. The metrics groups are based on forecast categories or pipeline changes. Number values for the metrics are shown in the user’s currency. Forecast category metrics are configurable as single or multiple category rollups. For summarizing metrics, Pipeline Inspection supports the Amount, field, and custom currency and number fields. Formula fields can’t be used as summary fields. Forecast Category Metrics Group The Forecast Category metrics show how your pipeline metrics map to the forecast categories in your company’s sales cycle. Note When multiple category rollups are enabled and the Most Likely category is set up, Most Likely is included in Best Case, Most Likely, Open Pipeline, and Total. Metric Represents the Total for Opportunities Best Case With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, Best Case, or Most Likely (optional). Closed Lost In a stage classified as Closed/Lost. Closed Won In a stage classified as Closed/Won. Commit With forecast categories of Closed or Commit. Most Likely With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, and Most Likely (optional). Open Pipeline With forecast categories of Best Case, Commit, Most Likely (optional), or Pipeline. Total With forecast categories of Closed, Commit, Best Case, Most Likely (optional), or Pipeline. Pipeline Changes Metrics Group The Pipeline Changes metrics show how your pipeline changes over time. The Close Date filter shows opportunities based on their scheduled close date for the time period you specified. The Changes Since filter defines the time period in which changes for these opportunities occurred. For example, a common snapshot a sales manager looks at is, “For my team’s opportunities with close dates in this quarter, what changes took place between the first day of the quarter and today?” To create a snapshot, pipeline metrics are compared over the two dates. To see this snapshot, select these filters: Close Date: This Quarter Owner: My Team Changes Since: Start of the Period To validate the change metrics, you can use one of these options: field history tracking, historical trend reporting, or opportunity stage history. From any of these sources, get the field values on the first day of the period and compare them to the current value. Example On the first day of the quarter, Bill has a $100,000 deal with Acme Co. with a close date in next quarter. As of today, the close date on the Acme deal is in this quarter and the deal is Closed Won. In the Pipeline Changes view, the metrics show $100,000 in Moved In and $100,000 in Won. Metric Represents the Total for Opportunities Open Pipeline With forecast categories of Best Case, Commit, Most Likely (optional), or Pipeline, and that have a close date currently within the close date filter range. New Created or reopened within the change date filter range, and that have a close date currently within the close date filter range. Won Won within the change date filter range and that have a close date currently within the close date filter range. Increased With an amount in the summary field that’s higher than at the beginning of the change date filter range. Opportunities in Increased are open opportunities that, when the time period in the change date filter started, had close dates in the period and are currently closing within the period. Moved In Moved into the close date filter range. The opportunities in Moved In are those opportunities that, when the time period in the change date filter started, had close dates in a future period. Moved Out Moved out of the close date filter range. The opportunities in Moved Out are those opportunities that, when the time period in the change date filter started, had close dates after the end of the close date period. Decreased With an amount in the summary field that’s lower than at the beginning of the change date filter range. Opportunities in Decreased are open opportunities that, when the change date filter period started, had close dates in the period and that are currently closing within the period. Lost Lost within the change date filter range, and that have a close date currently within the close date filter range. Overdue With close dates within the last 90 days and that are still open. Opportunity List Fields The default fields shown in the opportunity list in Pipeline Inspection include Pipeline Inspection fields and standard opportunity fields. These standard opportunity fields are in the list by default: Opportunity Name, Account Name, Amount, Close Date, Stage, Forecast Category, Next Step, Recent Activity, Opportunity Score (if enabled), Owner Full Name. For field descriptions, see Opportunity Fields . Salesforce admins can also add custom fields, with the exception of rich text area fields. Users can change and reorder some of the fields in the list. If Pipeline Inspection is enabled, some of the Pipeline Inspection fields are also visible on opportunities. Pipeline Inspection Field Description Age The number of days since the opportunity was created. Change The net change to the pipeline contributed by the opportunity over the selected time period. When users view the pipeline changes metrics group, the Change field shows when they filter the opportunity list by the Increased and Decreased metrics. Days In Stage The number of days the opportunity has spent in this stage since the last change to the Stage field. This field doesn’t represent the aggregate number of days spent in this stage. Important Whether the opportunity is tracked as important. Opportunity Score The Einstein Opportunity Score, shown in tiers. The opportunity score tiers are High (67-99), Medium (34-66), and Low (1-33). Tiered opportunity scores are available in Pipeline Inspection only. Push Count The number of times an opportunity’s close date was pushed out by a calendar month. The Push Count field isn’t shown in list views by default. Recent Activity The number of days since the most recent activity on the opportunity. This field can also show the number of days until the next scheduled activity.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Use forecasts to manage sales expectations and to project and plan your company’s sales cycle from pipeline to closed sales. A forecast is an expression of expected sales based on the gross rollup of a set of opportunities. The forecasts on the forecasts page are totals and subtotals of the opportunities in the forecast categories: Pipeline, Best Case, Commit, Closed, and Most Likely (optional category). Depending on how Salesforce is set up, these forecasts can reflect opportunities from one or multiple forecast categories. In the forecasts grid, forecasts are organized by forecast rollup, time period, and optionally by product family and territory. Forecasts can include adjustments made by forecast managers to their immediate subordinates’ forecasts and adjustments made by users to their own forecasts. Your admin can activate multiple forecast types that you can switch between. Each type of forecast stores its own quota and adjustment data. Users can view forecasts and their related opportunities by forecast rollup for an individual or for everyone below them in the forecast hierarchy. For example, they can see the July Best Case forecast for all the sales managers who report to them, all the sales reps who report to any one of their managers, or just one individual. Users can also adjust their own forecasts and the forecasts of subordinates and territories one level below. Both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience make these tasks simple. Conducting status calls based on real-time data with an opportunity team. Reviewing forecast summary information for single months or quarters and a multi-month or quarter range for each forecast rollup. If you use product families, seeing forecast summaries for each product family. In Lightning Experience, your Salesforce admin chooses the product families that you forecast on. If you use opportunity splits, seeing the split percentages and amounts that contribute to each forecast. Accessing details about the opportunities that are part of the forecast, all in one view. Making adjustments and viewing adjustment details, such as the original forecast and who made the adjustment. If multiple forecast types are active, each forecast type maintains separate adjustments. Viewing your own forecast and for forecast managers, the forecasts for your subordinates in the forecast hierarchy, navigating easily using breadcrumb links. Viewing both revenue- or quantity-based forecasts. Viewing forecasts in multiple currencies. Viewing quota information on each user’s forecast page. If multiple types of forecasts are enabled, each forecast type maintains separate quota information. Looking further into forecast perspectives and trends with reports. Including the opportunities of your partner portal users in your forecasts. And with Lightning Experience, you get even more from the forecasts page. Use quick actions to edit, delete, and change the owner of opportunities without leaving the forecasts page. Use inline editing to edit multiple opportunities without leaving the forecasts page. The pencil indicates editable fields. The lock indicates noneditable fields. If you’re a forecast manager, share your forecasts page with any Salesforce user at your company. See the date and time when the forecasts page was refreshed. (In-progress data updates aren’t indicated.) For all forecast types, hide rows that contain only zeros.

Each forecast type presents projected sales from a different perspective. Forecast Types Forecast types represent your sales teams’ projected sales from a different perspective. Each type can be set up to use different data, measures, dates, and filters to gather the forecast information that is most relevant to your business. Group Forecasts to Match Your Business Group forecasts into segments that make sense for your business. For example, define forecast groups that represent the industries your products and services serve or your company’s business units. You can also group forecasts by product family. Configure and Activate Forecast Types Let your sales team choose between forecast types to project sales from multiple perspectives. Schedule and Product Date Forecasts Base forecasts on schedule and product dates to reflect your business model. Schedule and product date forecasts are available in Lightning Experience only. Territory Forecasts If your sales team uses Sales Territories, Salesforce Forecasting, and Lightning Experience, they can forecast by territory. Territory forecasts give your team a snapshot of how expected sales compare between territories. Want to know which territory has the most closed deals this month? Or which territory is lagging in software deals? Use territory forecasts to find out.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud Custom measure forecasts available in: Performance, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud Each forecast type can be set up to use different data, including the object to base the forecast on, the field to roll up (measures), and how to group the forecast (date type). To refine the data that’s included in the forecast, add filters. Tip A default forecast type is defined for you based on the Opportunity object. The default type measures on the Amount field, by close date, and is based on the user role hierarchy. You can modify the opportunity list, select the columns to show in the forecast summary, apply filters, and modify the custom columns for that type. Or, create your own types to meet your business needs. Enabling multiple forecast types allows a different combination of the data shown for each forecast. Users can switch between active forecast types on the forecasts page. You can have up to four active forecast types at one time. If you require more active forecast types, contact Salesforce Customer Support. Note You can't activate legacy forecast types created before Summer '21. If a legacy forecast type is still needed, deactivate or delete the old type and recreate it. Review the options for creating forecast types. Depending on how Salesforce is set up, not every option is available. Object Measure Group Date Type Hierarchy Opportunity Amount (revenue) Quantity Custom currency (revenue) or number (quantity) Custom picklist Close date Custom date Territory User role Opportunity Product (Used for product family grouping and required for product date forecasts) Total price (revenue) Quantity Custom currency (revenue) or number (quantity) Custom picklist Product family Close date Custom date Product date* Territory* User role Opportunity Split (Required for opportunity splits forecasts) Amount (used with revenue, overlay, and custom currency split types) Custom currency (revenue) N/A Close date Custom date Territory User role Opportunity Product Split** (Required for opportunity product splits forecasts) Amount (used with revenue, overlay, and custom currency split types) Custom currency (revenue) Product Family Close date Custom date User role Line Item Schedule (Used for product family grouping and required for schedule date forecasts) Revenue Quantity Custom currency (revenue) or number (quantity) Product family Schedule date Territory User role *When forecasting by Opportunity Product (total price or quantity) for territory hierarchy, the Opportunity Product Date isn’t supported. Opportunity Close Date is supported. **Supported by product family only. Product Families If your company groups its products and services into families and wants to forecast based on those families, keep these considerations in mind. If you’re using Lightning Experience, you choose the product families to forecast on. The more product families you choose, the more rows appear in the forecasts grid. The forecasts grid shows up to 2,000 rows. The Forecasted Amount column in the opportunity list on the forecasts page shows the product family totals, not the overall opportunity totals that roll up into the forecast amounts. We recommend that you add this column to the opportunity list. Forecast users can view individual product family forecasts for users they have access to view. We recommend completing the Product Family field on each product record. Forecasts for products without a Product Family value appear in a forecast row titled Products Not Categorized. If an opportunity lacks products, the opportunity amount or quantity also appears in this row. Product family forecast totals aren’t available in Salesforce Classic. If users adjust their product family forecasts in Lightning Experience, not every total in the Salesforce Classic forecasts grid reflects the adjustments. In Salesforce Classic, a manager’s own product family forecasts aren’t available, so they can’t be adjusted. You can set separate product family quotas for each sales rep but not a single quota for each sales rep. Forecast Groups with Custom Picklists You can group forecasts into segments other than product families that make sense for your business. For example, define forecasts to group by industry or business unit. Keep these considerations in mind. Forecast groups are available for forecast types based on the Opportunity and Opportunity Product objects. Custom, single-selection picklist fields on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Product objects are available as forecast groups. Make your group and group value selections as you define the forecast type. We recommend completing the picklist field on each opportunity record. To include items that don’t have a value selected for the picklist, select Not Categorized when you select the group values for the forecast type. If a picklist selected as a forecast group in a forecast type is deactivated, forecasts continue to include opportunities that have a value selected for the picklist. Forecast groups using custom picklists aren’t available in Salesforce Classic or in the Salesforce mobile app. Opportunity Revenue Splits If your sales team uses team selling and opportunity splits, use an opportunity splits revenue forecast. Keep these considerations in mind. You must have team selling, opportunity splits, and the revenue split type enabled. In Salesforce Classic, an opportunity that contains only a single 100% revenue split shows “--” for the split percentage in the opportunity list. Opportunity Product Splits If your sales team uses team selling and opportunity product splits, use an opportunity product splits revenue forecast. Keep these considerations in mind. You must have team selling and opportunity product splits enabled. Forecasts for opportunity product splits are available with product families only. To forecast on opportunity product splits without product families, use the opportunity split object instead. Overlay Splits Use overlay splits to track revenue from sales team members who help close opportunities but aren’t directly responsible for them. You must have team selling, opportunity splits, and the overlay split type enabled. The overlay splits on a specific opportunity aren’t required to total 100%. Custom Measures If you have custom currency or number fields on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, Opportunity Split, or Line Item Schedule object, you can forecast on the values in those fields. To forecast on revenue, use a custom currency field. To forecast on quantity, use a custom number field. Custom Dates If you have custom fields based on the Date type on the Opportunity object, you can forecast using those dates for forecasts based on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, and Opportunity Splits objects. Expected Revenue If the value of the Amount field and the actual revenue brought in by the opportunity often differ, the Expected Revenue field on opportunities is useful. If your sales team anticipates this difference, consider using the Expected Revenue field and forecasting on it. You can forecast on revenue but not quantity. You can forecast on the Expected Revenue field regardless of whether you use opportunity splits with it. Regardless of whether you use splits with the Expected Revenue field, you must enable team selling, opportunity splits, and a custom split type for it. Territories If you use Sales Territories, you can forecast based on the territory hierarchy. Territory forecasts are available in Lightning Experience and the Salesforce mobile app for your active territory model only. When territory forecasts are enabled, the forecasts page shows this information. Forecast rollups based on the territories assigned to each opportunity Forecasts for the territories that the user is assigned to Territory forecasts shared to the user The opportunities included in territory forecasts, regardless of whether the opportunity owner is assigned to the territory Territory forecasts are based on your territory hierarchy, not your user role hierarchy, as other forecast types are. Users switch from role-based forecasts to territory-based forecasts by selecting a territory forecast type as a tab on the forecasts page. In territory forecasts, an opportunity is rolled up into one territory forecast only. If you use opportunity splits in a team selling scenario, each split on the opportunity only rolls up to one territory. Filter Opportunity Data from Forecast Types To include or exclude opportunity data from a forecast type, add a custom filter based on fields in the Opportunity object. For example, you can set up a custom filter for a forecast type that includes only renewal opportunities. When creating or modifying custom filters, keep these considerations in mind. Filter definitions aren’t editable after activating or reactivating the forecast type. Legacy forecast types that come ready-to-use with Forecasting don’t support custom filters. Filter definitions support up to three conditions and use the AND operator only. You can’t use custom multiselect picklist fields in custom filters. When you’re filtering on currency fields and you have a single currency enabled, the absolute value is used in the filter condition. If you have multiple currencies enabled, the corporate currency is used in the filter condition. See Also Organize Products with Product Families "

Grouping forecasts using a custom picklist is available for forecast types created in Spring ’24 or later that are based on the Opportunity and Opportunity Product objects. From Object Manager, add a custom single-selection picklist to the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Product object. You can also use a preexisting custom single-selection picklist.

From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings. In the Available Forecast Types section, create a forecast type based on the Opportunity or Opportunity Product object. If you added the picklist to the Product object, create the forecast using the Opportunity object. As you complete the forecast type setup flow, select the picklist to group by and select the values from the picklist to show in the forecast type. You can select up to 50 values from the identified custom picklist to include in the forecast. To see the group selection for each opportunity, add the picklist field as a column in the opportunity list for the forecast type. Save your changes, and then activate the forecast type. Group Forecasts by Product Family If your company groups its products and services into product families such as Hardware and Software, you can group forecasts using families instead of a custom picklist. Grouping forecasts by product family is available for forecasts based on the Opportunity Product, Line Item Schedule, and Opportunity Product Split objects. The product families you select to use in forecasts apply to all forecast types that are grouped using product families. If you require separate groups for each forecast type, use custom picklists instead. In Object Manager, define your company’s product families in the Product Family field on the Product object. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings . Ensure that at least one forecast type that groups by product family is active. In Forecasts Settings, in the Manage Product Family Groupings section, select the product families that you want to include in forecasts. Save your changes.

Schedule and product date forecasts are available in Lightning Experience only. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud How Schedule Date Forecasts Differ from Close Date Forecasts When you forecast by schedule date, Salesforce uses the values from a product schedule’s Date field and its Revenue, Quantity, or custom measure field to calculate forecasts. Example A $12,000 opportunity has a close date of June 30, 2018, with $1,000 revenue scheduled monthly. If you forecast by close date, forecasts for the month of June include $12,000 for the opportunity. If you forecast by schedule date, forecasts for the month of June include $1,000 for the opportunity. How Product Date Forecasts Differ from Close Date Forecasts When you forecast by product date, Salesforce uses the values from each opportunity product’s Date field and its Total Price, Quantity, or custom measure field to calculate forecasts. Example A $10,000 opportunity has a close date of June 30, 2018 and two products: laptops for $4,000 and desktops for $6,000. The $4,000 product date is June 30, 2018. The $6,000 product date is May 31, 2018. If you forecast by close date, forecasts for the month of May don’t include an amount for this opportunity. Forecasts for the month of June include $10,000 for this opportunity. If you forecast by product date, forecasts for the month of May include $6,000 for this opportunity. Forecasts for the month of June include $4,000 for this opportunity. Amounts on the Forecasts Page When you forecast by schedule or product date, the Forecasted Amount column in the opportunity list shows the amounts that contribute to forecasts, not the overall opportunity amounts. Forecasting Reports When you forecast by schedule or product date, custom report types with Forecasting Items as the primary object show the schedule-date and product-date forecast values. "

Territory forecasts give your team a snapshot of how expected sales compare between territories. Want to know which territory has the most closed deals this month? Or which territory is lagging in software deals? Use territory forecasts to find out. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Developer and Performance Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud When territory forecasts are enabled, the forecasts page shows the user the following. Forecast rollups based on the territories assigned to each opportunity Forecasts for the territories that the user is assigned to Territory forecasts shared to the user The opportunities included in territory forecasts, regardless of whether the opportunity owner is assigned to the territory Users can also drill down to: Child territories’ forecasts. An individual rep’s forecasts for a territory if the territory doesn’t have a forecast manager. Territory forecasts are based on your territory hierarchy, not your user role hierarchy, as other forecast types are. Users switch from role-based forecasts to territory-based forecasts by selecting a territory forecast type as a tab on the forecasts page. In territory forecasts, an opportunity is rolled up into one territory forecast only. If you use opportunity splits in a team selling scenario, each split on the opportunity only rolls up to one territory. Warning Deleting or archiving a territory model deletes the related forecast data. We recommend running the opportunity territory assignment filter and taking screenshots of the forecasts page. You can also export forecasting data, or create a snapshot before deleting or archiving a territory model. When you activate another territory model, you must add a territory forecast type for it. Who Sees What A territory’s forecast manager can view the forecasts for that territory. If the territory has other users assigned, those users can’t view that territory’s forecasts. Those users’ opportunities are rolled up into the territory’s forecasts and aren’t grouped by user. If a forecast manager is assigned, the territory’s opportunities roll up into the territory forecast, not the individual users’ forecasts. If no forecast manager is assigned, the opportunities are grouped based on the individual users within the territory. A “holdout” scenario occurs when a user owns an opportunity that’s assigned to a territory but the user isn’t assigned to the territory. For example, you own the Smith & Co. opportunity, and it’s assigned to your California territory, but you’re not assigned to the California territory. In this scenario, the opportunity list includes the opportunity, and the user appears in the forecasts grid but isn’t searchable. Forecast managers can share their forecasts with any Salesforce user at their company. When sharing, they specify whether a coworker can make adjustments or only view the shared forecasts. Forecast managers can’t share their summary view. Forecast users can see all their territory forecasts in the single-page summary view. The view shows forecasts for the top-level territories that users are assigned to in each branch of the territory hierarchy. Then users drill down to see their assigned child territories and the other child territories of the top-level territories. And if you’re using product family territory forecasts, summary view makes it easy to see how multiple territories’ forecasts roll up to a product family total. For example, let’s say your territory hierarchy has three branches: Canada, Mexico, and US. Canada and US have child territories. And every territory except Quebec has a forecast manager assigned, shown here in parentheses. Canada (Amy) Ontario (Amy) Quebec (No forecast manager. Dan and Kim are assigned as reps.) Mexico (Kim) US (Dan) CA (Amy) LA (Kim) SAC (Amy) SF (Dan) With your territory hierarchy set up this way: Amy sees forecasts for Canada and CA. Dan sees forecasts for Quebec and US. Kim sees forecasts for Quebec, Mexico, and LA. Then Amy and Dan can drill down to child territory forecasts. For example, Amy can get forecasts for Ontario and SAC. For Kim, no child territory forecasts are available. See Also Sales Territories Concepts Considerations for Managing Territory Forecasts "

If the forecast is based on that field, the Forecasted Amount column shows the value of the field or the value of the field’s split that contributes to the forecast, regardless of field-level security. When selecting fields, consider the fields that are used in the forecast rollup . Depending on whether your forecast type uses revenue, quantity, or a custom measure, consider adding the Amount, Quantity, or custom field to the list. If you’re forecasting on the Opportunity or Opportunity Product object, the Amount field appears by default. If you’re forecasting on the Opportunity Product or Line Item Schedule object, we recommend adding the Forecasted Amount field. If you’re forecasting on the Opportunity Split object, the Forecasted Amount and Split % fields appear by default. You can change the selected fields for each forecast type even after the forecast type has been activated.

Watch a video to learn how cumulative rollups work. Note The examples in this topic use the four forecast categories that are enabled by default. You can show a Most Likely category in Lightning Experience, rename single category rollups, and rename cumulative rollups. When added, Most Likely appears in the forecasts grid between Commit and Best Case. Rollup Method Column Name on the Forecasts Page Opportunities That Roll Up to It Single Category Pipeline Pipeline Best Case* Best Case Commit* Commit Closed Closed Cumulative Open Pipeline Pipeline Best Case Commit Best Case Forecast Best Case Commit Closed Commit Forecast Commit Closed Closed Only Closed * If forecasts adjustments are enabled and configured to show in columns, these column names are My Best Case and My Commit, respectively. Advantages of Cumulative Forecast Rollups With single category rollups, each total and subtotal represents opportunities from only one of the forecast categories. With this type of rollup, if forecast users want to see the total that they’re going to bring for the month or quarter, they add the Best Case, Commit, and Closed forecasts together. Example: Single Category Rollups Forecast amounts Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $100 $150 $200 Opportunities Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 With cumulative rollups, the forecast columns show cumulative amounts from the opportunities in the named forecast category and subsequent categories in your sales pipeline. This view makes it easy for sales team members to see the total numbers that they’re likely to bring in without combining the category totals themselves. For example, this table shows the cumulative forecast rollup amounts when there are four Pipeline, three Best Case, two Commit, and one Closed opportunity, each worth $50. Example: Cumulative Rollups Forecast amounts Closed Only Commit Forecast Best Case Forecast Open Pipeline $50 $150 $300 $450 Opportunities Closed Commit Best Case Pipeline $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 $50 "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Customizing the Forecasts Page Tailor your forecasts page to meet your business needs. Allow Adjustments and Manager Judgments in Forecasts Help your sales team produce the most accurate forecast possible. Enable managers or forecast users to adjust rollup values, and enable first-line forecast managers to apply their judgment to opportunities that their direct reports own in a forecast. Manager judgments are supported for forecast types based on opportunity, opportunity product, and line item schedule objects only. Allow Point-in-Time Forecast Submissions Forecast submissions are sales reps’ or managers’ best estimates of the revenue or quantities they expect to close during the forecast period. As management levels within the sales organization review forecast rollups, they compare the current forecast against the submitted forecast numbers and quota. Setting Up Quotas in Salesforce Forecasting Set up quotas so that users can see quotas and quota attainment information with their forecasts. Setting the Forecast Currency If your company uses multiple currencies, select whether to use your corporate currency in forecasts, or to use each forecast manager’s personal currency. Including Other Data in Custom Columns in Forecasts Make forecast decisions using all the data that matters to your business by adding custom columns to a forecast. Custom columns can show data that’s imported and referenced, such as Stretch Quota or Internal Booking Target, or a calculated value, such as gap to quota. Having all the information in one place helps you create more precise forecasts without having to turn to other resources. Set Up Historical Data for Forecasting Charts To give sales leaders the data they need when viewing forecasting charts, ensure that historical trending is on for Forecasting Item. Also verify that the retention period is set appropriately. Manage Opportunity Stage to Forecast Category Mappings Forecasts rely on how picklist values map between the Stage field and the Forecast Category field on opportunities. For example, if you map the Negotiation/Review stage to the Best Case forecast category, the amounts of your opportunities in Negotiation/Review are included in your Best Case forecast amount. If the stage of an opportunity changes, the probability and forecast category also change. Loading "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud If a custom page isn’t active for a user’s profile or your company, a default forecasts page is used and contains the forecasts components: Forecasts Header, Forecasts Summary, and Forecasts Opportunity List. Use the default template for the forecasts page type, or create your own compatible template to change the layout. To work correctly, each forecasts page requires a Forecasts Header component, which includes the selections for data range and other settings. For the best experience, include the Forecasts Summary and Forecasts Opportunity List components. To avoid unnecessary scrolling when the forecasts page loads, the focus is directed to the Forecasts Summary component. Place that component near the top of the page. If you include the Tab and Accordion components on your page, the components nested in those tabs don’t respond to selections made in the Forecasts Header on the page. Tab and Accordion components work best for components that aren’t dependent on forecasting. The forecasts page type supports custom Lightning Web Components and Aura components. Custom components added to a forecast page can respond to data published from the Forecasts Header, Forecasts Summary, and Forecasts Opportunity List components. However, the forecasts components themselves aren’t able to respond to data published from a custom component.

Enable Adjustments Allow forecast users who anticipate differences between the current forecast values and future sales results to adjust the forecast rollup values in their forecasts. You specify whether forecast managers can adjust subordinates’ and child territory forecasts, whether forecast users can adjust their own forecasts, or both. If multiple forecast types are active, each forecast type maintains separate adjusted amounts. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings . In the Enable Adjustments and Judgments section, select who can make forecast adjustments: To let forecast managers adjust the forecasts of their immediate subordinates and child territories, select Manager adjustments . This setting is on by default. To let all forecast users adjust their own forecasts, including the territory forecasts that they own, select Owner adjustments . Select to show adjustments when you’re hovering over adjustable forecast category cells in the forecast summary or show as separate columns for each adjustable forecast category. Selecting to show adjustments as columns adds columns for each adjustable forecast category on the forecasts page. For each adjustable forecast category, up to three columns are shown. A column with the original forecast value before any adjustments If owner adjustments are enabled, a column with the forecast user’s direct reports’ adjustments A column with the forecast user’s own adjustments Any notes about an adjustment are viewable when you hover over the column. If you change how to show adjustments, no adjustment data is lost. Save your changes. Ensure that each user who adjusts forecasts has the Override Forecasts user permission in their profile. This permission is available in the standard profile by default. Rename Adjustment Columns If you select to show adjustments as columns on the forecasts page, you can change the default column names to fit your sales model and business practices. For example, rename the My Commit column to Call or Call Number to indicate that it’s your best estimate about the forecast. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings . Edit the Enable Adjustments and Judgments section. Ensure at least one adjustment option is selected, adjustments are shown as columns, and that those settings are saved. After the adjustment settings are saved, see the table and update the column names for each adjustable category. Whether you selected Manager Adjustments or Owner Adjustments determines which columns are available to rename. Ensure that the column names you add match the category and the behavior described. If the browser window is resized, column names are truncated. We recommend using short names. Save your changes. Important The changes you make in the table update adjustment column names only. For instructions to change category names, see Customize Salesforce Forecasting Categories . Enable Manager Judgments Allow forecast managers to indicate which of their subordinates’ opportunities they have high confidence of closing during the current forecast period. To get the most benefit out of manager judgments, we recommend also enabling managers to make adjustments at the forecast rollup level. From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings . Edit the Enable Adjustments and Judgments section and select Manager Judgments . To change the picklist values that are available in the Manager Judgment field in the forecasts opportunity list to meet your business needs, edit the values in the provided table. Ensure that the values you add match the behavior described for each value. The IN value is used to indicate opportunities that a forecast manager feels are definitely going to close and roll up as and are part of a forecast adjustment. The OUT value indicates opportunities that a forecast manager doesn’t want to include in the forecast and are excluded from the.roll up. If you change the judgment values, check whether they have translations and update them as needed. Any translation values are shown in the user’s selected language on the forecasts page. For more information, see Translation Workbench . The translated values aren’t included on the Setup page. Save your changes. For each forecast type that you want to allow manager judgments in, edit the forecast type’s opportunity list to include the Manager Judgment column. For user role hierarchy forecast types, ensure that the opportunity list also includes the Owner Full Name column. For territory-based forecast types, add the Territory Name column. To see the column in the Salesforce mobile app, make sure it’s one of the first four columns in the opportunity list. Ensure that each forecast manager has the Override Forecasts user permission in their profile. This permission is available in the standard profile by default. Disable Forecast Adjustments and Manager Judgments If you no longer want forecast managers and users to adjust forecasts, or forecast managers to apply judgment to opportunities in a forecast, disable the options in Setup. Updating user permissions isn’t required to disable either option. Warning Disabling forecast adjustments removes existing adjustments for all forecast types. Before disabling these features, see Manager Judgment and Forecast Adjustment Deletions . From Setup, in the Quick Find box, enter Forecasts Settings , and then select Forecasts Settings .

Available in: All editions with Sales Cloud When forecasting is enabled, for each fiscal year that includes forecastable items, 17 period rows are generated, with 1 row for: Each month of the year (12 rows total) Each quarter of the year (4 rows total) For the entire year (1 row total) The default date range and forecastable items for a user determine which fiscal years forecast periods are generated for. Default Date Range The date range that’s set in the Choose a Default Date Range section of the Forecast Settings page specifies which forecast periods are shown by default on the forecasts page. To make sure that all forecast periods within the specified range are available, forecast periods are generated for each fiscal year in the maximum range. Each Forecast User Period rows are generated between the earliest fiscal year that a user has a forecastable item and the latest fiscal year, up to 10 years in the future from the current period. In some cases forecast period rows are generated for only the year that a forecastable item is created in. A forecastable item is created beyond the current range of forecast periods available. For example, if your current periods go out to 2028, and you create a forecastable item in 2030, period rows are created for 2030, but not for 2029. If the dimensions for your forecast change, such as a user changes roles in the hierarchy or your fiscal year changes, periods for the user are recalculated and the periods for year 2029 are generated at the time. A forecastable item is created in the past. For example, if you have preexisting periods from 2020 to 2025, and you create a forecastable item in 2017, forecast periods for the fiscal year 2017 are created, but not for 2018 and 2019. A change in forecasting dimensions doesn’t create periods for 2018 and 2019 in this case. "

Forecast with Confidence Using Salesforce Salesforce Forecasting Elements If you’re using forecasting features in Salesforce, learn about the elements that comprise a forecast. Forecasting Best Practices Review key guidelines to get the most out of your opportunity-based forecasts. Managing Forecast Types Forecasts types in specify how Salesforce calculates forecasts and projects sales from a different perspective. Learn about the forecast types available. Managing Forecast Quotas A forecast quota is the monthly or quarterly sales goal that’s assigned to a sales team member or territory. A manager’s quota equals the amount that the manager and team are expected to generate together. The quota rollup is done manually by users and managers, and revenue or quantity data can be used. If you have multiple types of forecasts enabled, each type maintains separate quota information. Viewing Forecasts Learn the basics of viewing forecast information. Capturing Forecast Data at a Point in Time Forecast submissions are your best estimate of the revenue or quantities that you expect to close during the forecast period. Typically required weekly, the submission takes a snapshot of your forecast at the time you make the submission. As management levels review forecast rollups, they compare the current forecast against the submitted forecast numbers and quota, and know that the forecast is up to date. Any differences better inform the forecast for the entire sales team and the business. Defining the Path to Your Committed Forecast Forecast managers at all levels review, analyze, and adjust forecasts based on their knowledge of the team, the opportunities that are in process, and the current sales landscape. Depending on your system settings, forecast managers can apply their judgment to their direct subordinate’s opportunities that they have the highest confidence to close, and forecast users and forecast managers can adjust forecasts at the rollup level. Share Forecasts with Stakeholders Increase visibility into your forecast and ensure stakeholders can view, adjust, submit, and report on projected sales. For example, a sales manager can share her forecasts with Sales Ops for reporting purposes, or with another sales manager while she’s out of the office.

Measure everything related to potential deals—activities such as emails, meetings, and outreach—to determine their contributions to revenue. Create actionable tasks with next steps and completion dates pertaining to opportunities. Map your sales stages to forecast categories. To increase your forecast accuracy, adjust close probability based on historical data. When adjusting forecasts, have conversations with your subordinates so that they understand your expectations. Because opportunities can change frequently, revisit forecast adjustments weekly to avoid out-of-date adjustments. To ensure that everyone can access the forecasts they need, designate each sales manager with subordinates as a forecast manager in your role-based forecast hierarchy. Also assign a territory manager to each territory for which you want rolled-up forecasts. Customize your forecast category names so they match your business process and terminology. Navigating Forecast Information Forecast users can jump to the forecasts of users and territories that they have access to view. Begin typing a name in the search (Lightning Experience) or “Jump to” (Salesforce Classic) box, and then select the name. If you’ve enabled territory forecasts, type three or more letters to see results for users and territories. To expand a row on the forecasts page, click it. Navigation links with the names of forecast managers appear at the top of the page as you drill down through the forecast hierarchy. Click these links to quickly move through the hierarchy. Viewing Forecast Information Keep your window sized to 1,024 pixels or greater. To view forecast amounts in the forecast summary grid without decimal places, select Show Rounded Amounts from the Display Settings. Full amounts that include the decimal places are shown in the opportunity list header when you select the forecast cell. Decimal places are also included when you’re viewing adjustment and change details. Showing rounded amounts can help maximize screen space. In Lightning Experience, if multiple forecast types are enabled, you can select which forecasts you want to view as tabs using the Edit Tab Selections option from the gear icon. In Salesforce Classic, select the forecast from the upper-right dropdown list on the forecasts page. Column width in the forecast grid and the opportunity list is adjustable. In Lightning Experience, a timestamp shows the date and time when the forecasts page was refreshed. In-progress data updates aren’t indicated. In Lightning Experience, rows that have only zero values, including rows with only zero or no quota, are shown by default. To hide all-zero rows except for rollups of subordinates and child territories, deselect Show Rows with All Zero Values in the Display Options on the forecasts page. In Salesforce Classic, this option is available only for product family forecasts. If a coworker has shared forecasts with you, select the coworker’s name from the My Shared Forecasts list to access the shared forecasts. Analyze trends and check performance using forecast reports. Create dashboards for metrics of all activities related to potential sales. Collaboration If you’re a forecast manager, share opportunity and forecast information with your team and bring attention to important details. In Salesforce Classic, if Chatter is enabled, hover over a subordinate’s name, and click Chat Now to display Chatter options, such as Follow or Send a message. In Lightning Experience, share your forecasts page with any Salesforce user at your company. Your coworker sees the same view that you see. When you share, specify whether the coworker can adjust forecasts or only view them.

Available in: Lightning Experience in Performance, Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud Important The information in this topic applies to custom measures in Lightning Experience in Performance, Professional, Enterprise, and Unlimited editions. For Salesforce Classic, see the Notes About Salesforce Classic section in this topic. A measure is used to calculate forecasts. Measures are based on number (quantity) or currency (revenue) fields from the object being that information is gathered from for a forecast. By default, and depending on the object you use, you can calculate forecasts based on revenue using the standard Amount, Revenue, or Total Price fields or by quantity using the Quantity field. Depending on the object you select for a forecast type, one or more of these fields are available to select as the measure for that type. If you have a specific business model that requires the forecast calculations to happen using values from a custom currency or number field that you use to capture revenue or quantity. Depending on the object used for forecasts, this custom field is then available and selected as the measure in a forecast type. Use these field types to define a custom field that is available as a custom measure in a forecast type. Currency: Use a custom currency field to forecast on revenue. For example, create a custom currency field to capture Monthly Recurring Revenue or Annual Contract Value to create forecasts on those values. A custom currency field as a custom measure is available if you base forecasts on Opportunity, Opportunity Product, Opportunity Split, or Line Item Schedule objects. Number: Use a custom number field to forecast on quantity. For example, create a custom number field to capture the number of Net New Subscriptions to create forecasts on those values. A custom number field as a custom measure is available if you base forecasts on the Opportunity, Opportunity Product, or Line Item Schedule objects. When using a custom measure, be sure to select the field that you’re using as a measure as one of the fields available as a column in the opportunity list on the forecast page. If users don’t have access to the custom field used for the measure, they can still see the forecasts based on the measure. They can’t see the values for the custom field in the opportunity list. Notes About Salesforce Classic In Salesforce Classic, you can forecast on custom currency fields via an opportunity split, if the custom field is enabled for opportunity splits. The opportunity owner automatically receives a 100% split for the field. So, if your company doesn’t plan to use splits with the field, the rollup is the same as if no splits existed.

Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud As a sales manager, use revenue splits for crediting team members who are directly responsible for opportunities. To provide more flexibility with how you assign credit for opportunities, you can use overlay splits. Overlay splits help you and other team members allocate credit to overlay sales roles for working on opportunities. Overlay splits can add up to any percentage of the opportunity amount, sometimes exceeding 100%. For example, your sales team can include sales engineers, product specialists, or partners who help close deals but aren’t directly responsible for them. When you forecast on overlay splits, forecast amounts roll up through the role hierarchy based on the opportunity’s Amount field and the overlay team member’s split percentage. Let’s say a sales rep, Allison, has an opportunity that includes an overlay split of 50% for sales engineer Owen, who’s working with Allison on the deal. For Allison, the opportunity Amount field rolls up into her opportunity revenue forecast. Allison’s manager Bryce can view the overlay forecast along with all the other opportunities that his sales engineer team is working on. Bryce can see that Allison is receiving a 100% credit for her deal, which contributes to Allison’s open pipeline total and Bryce’s open pipeline total. If Bryce thinks the deal could close for a higher amount, he can adjust the commit or best case forecast amount. Loading "

Available in: both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud In product family forecasts, sales managers can’t see their own quotas and quota attainment for individual product families. Only their total quota appears in the rollup table. For example, if three sales reps have combined quota amounts of $75,000 and their forecast manager has an individual quota of $30,000, the manager’s quota is $105,000. In forecast types based on opportunity revenue or quantity, the quota value shown in the month or quarter row is the quota input for that month or quarter. For example, if a manager's quota is input as $500 for February, $500 is shown as the quota for February. The quota value in the Total row is the sum of the month and quarter values. In forecast types based on opportunity with user role or territory with product family, and in the My Territory summary view, the quota value shown in the month or quarter row is the sum value. For example, if a manager’s quota is $500 for February, and their single subordinate’s quota for February is $500, the quota shown for February is $1000. The quota value in the Total row is the sum of all month or quarter values. You can edit direct subordinates’ quotas only (“Manage Quotas” permission required)—not your own. In territory forecasts, quotas can be assigned to the forecast manager if one is defined. If the territory doesn’t have a forecast manager, quotas can be assigned to a user who is a member of the territory.

Forecast Hierarchy The forecast hierarchy is a nested, expandable list of forecast users or territories that determine how forecasts roll up within a company and who can view and adjust them. View Forecasts from Different Perspectives If your Salesforce admin activates multiple forecast types, select the forecasts that are relevant to you as tabs on the forecast page. Then, you can quickly access each tab to review your forecast from different perspectives. See Recent Changes in Forecast Value To help you identify recent changes in value to a forecast, changes within the last 7 days are highlighted in the forecast summary. As a sales leader, you don’t want to be caught unaware of changes in your team’s forecast. Choose to show week-over-week changes for each forecast category so that you can adjust your sales and forecasting strategies accordingly. Salesforce Forecasting Charts Use built-in charts to visualize the state of your forecasts and better assist sales reps in meeting their sales targets. With forecast charts, see the changes to the current period’s forecasts across forecast types and measure how this period’s forecasts compares to past periods, without having to manually crunch the numbers. Monthly and Quarterly Forecasts In the Forecasts page, the summary shows forecasts for individual months or quarters and a range of months or quarters, depending on the settings your Salesforce admin defines. Your admin can also enable custom periods. Change Your Forecast Date Range on the Forecasts Page Your Salesforce admin sets up a default forecast date range display. For example, your default can be three months into the future. Use this range, or change the date range that’s shown for your own forecast. Partner Portal User Opportunities in Forecasts Partner portal users are external to your Salesforce org but sell your products and services through indirect sales channels. Your partner portal users use a portal to log in to Salesforce. Partners can create opportunities, and users can assign opportunities to them. Guidelines for Viewing Opportunity Details in Forecasts Review key guidelines for viewing the opportunity details on the forecasts page. Guidelines for Refreshing Forecasts Certain actions can change forecasts. For example, while you’re viewing the forecasts page, your subordinates can edit related opportunities and adjust the forecasts of their own subordinates.

Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions To review charts for a forecast, toggle to the Chart view on the forecasts page. You have access to charts for your forecasts across all forecast types and any of your subordinates. Here’s a Weekly Changes chart example where quota and cumulative category rollups are enabled. Depending on your system setup, your chart can look different. Metrics indicate key information as of today. Each metric also includes the percent change from the same time last week. Metric Description Target Commit compared to quota. If the commit value is greater than quota, the user is on target to meet or exceed their quota for the period. Commit Total commit value. In cumulative category rollups, this value includes opportunities in the Commit and Closed forecast categories. Gap to Quota Quota minus Closed Won, which indicates how much is needed to meet quota. Closed Won Total value of opportunities that have been won and are now closed. Pipe Coverage Open pipeline divided by quota. If quota data isn’t available, the metrics that require quota aren’t shown. If Einstein Forecasting is enabled and its data requirements are met, additional AI-generated metrics about forecast predictions are shown. Bar Chart Segments Each time segment shows opportunities grouped by their forecast category. If you use single category rollups, open pipeline is represented as a bar segment. For cumulative category rollups, the open pipeline is shown as a dot on the chart. Hover over each segment for details about the changes compared to the previous week. Metric Description Forecast Amount The total forecast for the category including any adjustments made. The weekly and monthly changes including adjustments are included below the value. This value is shown when viewing the chart with adjustments. Amount Without Adjustments The total forecast for the category without adjustments. The weekly and monthly changes without adjustments are indicated below this value. This value is shown when viewing the chart without adjustments. Weekly Change and Weekly Percent The percentage difference compared to the same time last week. For example, if you’re viewing changes 2 days from the end of the week, the comparison is made to when there were 2 days from the end of last week. Monthly Change The percentage difference compared to the same time last month, based on time remaining in the month. For example, if there are currently 20 days remaining in the current month, the comparison is made to the day when there were 20 days remaining in the previous month. For example, July has 31 days, while June has 30. Therefore, July 11 is compared to June 10. If Einstein Forecasting is enabled and its data requirements are met, the chart includes AI-driven predicted values for future weeks through the end of the period.

Understanding your team’s trends helps to gauge whether the team is tracking to hit their sales goals based on performance in previous periods. The information that’s available to you in the chart depends on enabled features and how long forecast data is retained. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise and Unlimited Editions To review charts for a forecast, toggle to the Chart view on the forecasts page. You have access to charts for your forecasts across all forecast types and any of your subordinates. Here’s a Trends chart example where quota and cumulative category rollups are enabled. Depending on your system setup, your chart can look different. Each bar in the chart represents the same point in time in a previous period (month or quarter). In this example, the Today bar marks 45 days before the end of the current quarter. Other bars show the forecast when 45 days remained in previous quarters. Metrics are shown to provide key information as of today. Where applicable, metrics also show the comparison to the last period and the same time last year. Metric Description Quota Attainment Closed Won divided by quota. Closed Won Total value of opportunities that have been won and are now closed. Open Pipeline Opportunities that haven’t closed. Comparison Point The number of days remaining in the current period. This number is the point in the period that is used to compare the current period to the previous periods. If quota data isn’t available, the metrics that require quota aren’t shown. Bar Chart Segments For quarterly forecast periods, the chart includes five bars (one for each historical period over the last year, and one for today). For monthly forecasts, the chart includes 13 bars (12 bars for each historical month, and 1 bar for today). If you’re new to Salesforce, or only recently enabled historical trending, your chart contains data only for the periods that it has data for. Each forecast period segment shows opportunities grouped by the forecast category, including indicators for open pipeline and quota targets. Hover over each segment in a past period for details about how that period compares to today’s forecast. Values are calculated as follows. Metric Description Forecast Amount The total forecast for the category, including adjustments. This value is shown when viewing the chart with adjustments. Amount Without Adjustments The total forecast for the category without adjustments. This value is shown when viewing the chart without adjustments. vs Today The difference in value between the forecast value for the period and the value today. Hover over each segment in the Today bar for details about how today’s forecast compares to the same time last period and last year. Values are calculated as follows. Metric Description Forecast Amount The total forecast for the category, including adjustments. This value is shown when viewing the chart with adjustments. Amount Without Adjustments The total forecast for the category without adjustments. This value is shown when viewing the chart without adjustments. vs STLP The percentage difference from the same time last period, based on time remaining in the period. For example, if there are 20 days remaining in the current period, the comparison is made to the day when there were 20 days remaining in the previous period. If the current period has more days than the last period, the same time last period is the first day of the previous period. For example, 85 days are left in Q4, which has 90 days. But Q3 had 80 days. In this case, the same time last period is calculated using the first day of Q3. vs STLY The percentage difference from the same time last year, based on the number of days remaining in the period. For example, if 85 days are left in Q3 2023, the comparison is made to the day when 85 days were left in Q3 2022.

Adjusting Best Case and Commit forecasts values is a way to accurately gauge where a sales team is on their path to hitting its sales numbers. An adjustment doesn’t change the underlying gross rollup and doesn’t appear in reports. It just adds a layer of detail to a forecast. Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Professional, Performance, and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud For more accuracy and clarity, managers can indicate which opportunities are part of their committed, adjusted forecast by applying their own judgment to the opportunities in the forecast. See Manager Judgments in Forecasts for details. Your Salesforce admin can enable forecast managers to adjust subordinates’ and child territory forecasts, enable all forecast users to adjust their own forecasts (including territory forecasts they own), or both. Depending on your system settings, forecast managers can: Adjust their own Best Case and Commit forecasts and the forecasts of subordinates one level below them in the forecast hierarchy. The Salesforce mobile app supports owner adjustments only. Adjust forecasts that don’t include adjustments and forecasts that include adjustments made by someone else on their opportunity team. View adjustments that subordinates make at every level below them in the forecast hierarchy. Adjustments made to their subordinates’ forecasts roll up into their own forecasts. For example, let’s say you’re a sales manager who adjusted the forecast of one of your sales reps down from $2,000 to $1,500. Your vice president, who’s your forecast manager, sees $1,500 when viewing your forecast, along with an icon indicating that the forecast contains an adjustment. The vice president can decide to adjust it back to $2,000. Any adjustments that the managers make to subordinates’ forecasts from their own forecast page don’t appear on the subordinate’s forecasts page. Instead, the managers see that subordinate’s forecasts and any adjustments that the subordinates made to their own forecasts or forecasts of their subordinates. For example, let’s say you’re a vice president of sales. On your own forecasts page, you see a July Best Case forecast of $1,250 (including a $50 adjustment that you made) for one of your first-level subordinates, a sales manager. However, when you view the sales manager’s forecasts page, the July Best Case forecast is $1,200, because it doesn’t include your adjustment. If a manager and a subordinate adjust the same forecast, only the manager’s adjustment rolls up the forecast hierarchy. Note While you’re viewing a forecasts page, your subordinates can be adjusting their own forecasts or editing related opportunities. Or you can adjust one of your subordinates’ forecasts from your own page. All these events change forecasts. To view the most recent forecasts, click Refresh . In Lightning Experience, a timestamp shows the date and time when the forecasts page was refreshed. In-progress data updates aren’t indicated. Adjustment Details Your Salesforce admin can configure adjustments to show only in a window when you hover over a forecast cell, or to break out adjustment amounts into separate columns. If Salesforce is configured to show adjustments when hovering over the cell, you see one forecast value per row for each category shown in the forecast summary. That value represents the last adjusted value for that category. If the cell includes a icon, the forecast value includes an adjustment. Hover over the cell to review these details. The original forecast value before any adjustments were made. The adjusted value from your team (seen by forecast managers only). Your total Closed + IN judgments, if manager judgments are enabled (seen by forecast managers only) Any notes that you entered about adjustments that you made. If Salesforce is configured to break out adjustments into separate columns, expand an adjustable forecast category to see the following forecast values. The original forecast value before any adjustments were made. Your team’s adjustments (if owner adjustments are enabled and you’re a forecast manager). If a value in any column includes an adjustment, the cell includes a icon. Your adjustments are shown in the My <category> column, for example, My Commit. To see these details, hover over the cell. Your total Closed + IN judgments, if manager judgments are enabled (seen by forecast managers only) Any notes that you entered about adjustments that you made. To see the details about team adjustments, go to your direct report’s forecast view. Note If there are changes in the last 7 days, you can also see the details about those changes when hovering over the cell. However, the icon doesn’t indicate those types of changes. Adjustments and Multiple Active Forecast Types If multiple forecast types are active, each forecast type maintains separate adjustments. For example, if opportunity revenue and quantity forecasts are enabled, you can adjust forecasts for each type. However, adjustments made in the opportunity revenue-based forecast aren’t shown as adjustments in any other forecast type. So if you adjust an opportunity revenue forecast from $100,000 to $90,000, and then switch your forecast view, you don’t see an equivalent adjustment value in the opportunity quantity forecast. If you change the forecast view back to the opportunity revenue forecast, you see your adjustment of $90,000. Adjustments and Product Family Forecasts If you use product family forecasts, you can’t adjust your own product family forecasts in Salesforce Classic. If users adjust their product family forecasts in Lightning Experience, not every total in the Salesforce Classic forecasts grid reflects the adjustments. Adjustments When Opportunities Move Between Forecast Categories When an opportunity moves from one forecast category to another, such as from Pipeline to Best Case, the unadjusted raw forecasts change for each of those rollups. However, forecasts with adjustments don’t change in the summary on the forecasts page. To account for changes in the stage of opportunities, update or remove your adjustments to each forecast rollup.

Select the folder in which your Salesforce admin has placed the forecasting report types. For example, many admins store Forecasting Items and Forecasting Quotas reports in a Forecasts folder. If you don’t see the fields or report type names described in this table, check with your admin. If a report that uses a specific forecast type doesn’t run, that forecast type was likely deleted. Check with your admin. Reports contain the latest information at the time when you run the report. If changes are in progress while the report is running, you can see a difference between your reports and the forecasts page. The data available to you in a report depends on what you have access to and can view in Salesforce Forecasting. For example, forecast managers can view adjustments, but someone who’s not a forecast manager running a similar report doesn’t see the adjusted forecasts in reports. A forecast can consist of a rollup of many users’ forecasts, so examine report results closely when using summary fields. Report Element How to See It A forecast summary from a specific user’s perspective. Create a Forecasting Item report, and add a filter using Owner: Full Name. Filter by the person’s name. A forecast summary from a specific territory’s perspective. Create a Forecasting Item or Forecasting Quotas report, and add a filter using Territory: Label. Filter by the territory’s name. Forecasting Item and Forecasting Quotas reports don’t include territory-based forecasts in either of these situations. You select the My direct reports’ forecasting items or My direct reports’ forecasting quotas filter. Both role-based and territory-based forecast types are enabled, and you select the All forecasting items or All forecasting quotas filter. The sum of a person’s revenue opportunities, without adjustments. Include Owner Only Amount in your Forecasting Item report. For example, if you own two opportunities, each worth $10,000, the Owner Only Amount is $20,000. To view the same information for quantity (for role-based forecasts only) , add Owner Only Quantity to the report. The sum of a person’s owned revenue opportunities and the person’s subordinates’ opportunities, without adjustments. Subordinates include everyone reporting up to a person in the forecast hierarchy. This amount is visible only on reports. Include Amount Without Adjustments in your Forecasting Item report. For example, if the sum of the amount of all opportunities that you own is $20,000, and the sum of the amount of your subordinates’ opportunities is $55,000, the Amount Without Adjustments is $75,000. To view the same information for quantity (for role-based forecasts only), add Quantity Without Adjustments to the report. The forecast number as seen by the forecast owner. This number is the sum of the owner’s revenue opportunities and the owner’s subordinates’ opportunities, including adjustments made by the forecast owner on the owner’s or subordinates’ forecasts. It doesn’t include adjustments made by forecast managers above the owner in the forecast hierarchy. Include Amount Without Manager Adjustments in your Forecasting Item report. For example, Anne has an Amount Without Adjustments of $75,000, made up of $20,000 of her own opportunities and $55,000 of opportunities owned by Ben, her subordinate. She adjusts Ben’s amount to $65,000 for a total of $85,000. If you adjust Anne’s number from $85,000 to $100,000, you see $85,000 in Amount Without Manager Adjustments because that’s the amount Anne sees. Anne can’t see your adjustments because you’re her manager. To see the amount that includes your adjustment to $100,000, look at Forecast Amount. To view the same information for quantity (for role-based forecasts only), add Quantity Without Manager Adjustments to the report. The revenue forecast from the forecast manager’s perspective and the sum of the owner’s and subordinates’ opportunities, including all forecast adjustments. Include Forecast Amount in your Forecasting Item report. For example, you’re a forecast manager and have another forecast manager reporting to you who has an Amount Without Manager Adjustment totaling $85,000. If you adjust the forecast to $100,000, the Forecast Amount is $100,000. To view the same information for quantity (for role-based forecasts only), add Forecast Quantity to the report. Whose forecasts have adjustments made to them. Include Has Adjustment in your Forecasting Item report. For example, if you make a manager adjustment to one of your subordinate’s forecasts, this checkbox is selected. If your subordinate adjusts one of their subordinate’s forecasts, this checkbox is selected. However, unless you have the View All Data permission, if your forecast manager adjusts your forecast, this checkbox remains deselected. You don’t have access to your forecast manager’s adjustment information. Also add Has Owner Adjustment. If forecast users adjust their own forecasts, this checkbox is selected. Quota detail for your forecasts. Create a Forecasting Quotas report. For example, depending on how your Salesforce admin set up the report type, you can include fields, such as the full name of the quota owner and territory. Then you can filter by your own name to see quotas that you created and their related accounts, owners, and territories. How forecasts today compare with earlier forecasts. Create a Forecast with Historical Trending report, and then compare the value of the Forecast Amount field at the beginning of the month with its value at the end of the month, sorted by owner. To create the report, switch to Salesforce Classic. You can run the report in Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic. Results for your direct reports only. When creating a forecasting report, choose My Direct Reports’ <item name> from the Show Me (Lightning Experience) or Show (Salesforce Classic) menu. The report shows results only for role-based forecast types. Which type of forecast the results are from. Refer to the Forecasting Type: API Name field in the report results. This field is included in the default page layout for Forecasting Item and Forecasting Quota reports.

Customizing this Flow means users can define the formulas used, the number of opportunities shown, and the criteria that define what marks an opportunity risky in a way that brings the most value to sellers and managers. Available in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions with the Einstein for Sales add-on The Get Forecast Guidance Flow is initiated when a user utterance associated with the Get Forecast Guidance copilot action is sent to Copilot. The Flow then checks for specific forecast settings and preferences, computes the gap-to-quota for Commit and Most Likely, and pulls opportunities in both categories to assess if any are at risk. Constants Given the size and complexity of the Flow, we recommend modifying only the constant elements found in the Flow. Constants store a fixed value to be used throughout a Flow. Review the constants present in the Get Forecast Guidance Flow and update values as needed to best align with how you want to receive forecast guidance. API Name What It Stores Default Value OpportunityScoreThreshold The opportunity score threshold used to determine whether an opportunity is at risk. To use a different threshold, change 33 to the value you want to use. 33 EndOfPeriodThreshold The ending time period within a forecasting period that qualifies an opportunity as risky based on the close date, as a percentage. To customize the end of the period, change 0.25 to the decimal value you want to use. 0.25 FutureActivitiesDateRange The number of days beyond today’s date to use to determine which activities to consider for each opportunity at risk. To customize, change 90 to the value you want to use. 90 OpenServiceCasesThreshold The number of open service cases used to determine whether an opportunity is at risk. To use a different threshold, change 0 to the value you want to use. 0 RiskFactorCountThreshold The number of risk factors each opportunity can have before the opportunity is considered at risk. To use a different threshold, change 3 to the value you want to use. 3 ContactCountThreshold The minimum number of contacts that is used to determine whether an opportunity is at risk. To use a different threshold, change 2 to the value you want to use. 2 AtRiskOpportunitiesToShowCount The number of at risk opportunities to show in output. To include a different number, change 5 to the value you want to use. 5 Gap-to-Quota Calculations Different formulas are used throughout the Get Forecast Guidance Flow to calculate and determine whether a sales rep meets their quota for Commit and Most Likely. These formulas can be modified directly in the formula resource to best align with your business standards.

CURRENCYRATE({!GetForecastingUserPreference.ForecastingViewCurrency}) * {!GapToMostLikelyFormula} PeriodTypeDurationRiskFormula The number of days in the last EndOfPeriodThreshold percentage of the current period of the forecast context when an opportunity is considered to be at risk. To change the percentage of days that’s considered risky, change the value in EndOfPeriodThreshold. CASE({!GetCurrentPeriod.Type}, ""Week"", 7, ""Month"", 30, ""Quarter"", 90, ""Year"", 365, 30) * EndOfPeriodThreshold RiskCriteriaPastEventDateRangeFormula The date that’s PastActivitiesDateRange days before the current date. {!$Flow.CurrentDate} - {!PastActivitiesDateRange} RiskCriteriaFutureEventDateRangeFormula The date that’s FutureActivitiesDateRange days after the current date. {!$Flow.CurrentDate} + {!FutureActivitiesDateRange} Copilot’s Response Copilot’s response in the Get Forecast Guidance copilot action is generated from the forecastGuidance variable in the Get Forecast Guidance flow. The forecastGuidance variable pulls text from the various text templates included throughout the flow and uses those texts to populate the rich text response in the copilot side panel.

Compare your forecasts with actual results to make smart adjustments for more accurate forecasts, engage with the right customers to close deals, alter account strategies, and boost your pipeline to meet your sales goals. Available in: Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions To get the whole picture about your forecast and the pipeline that’s there to fill it, gather and prepare data from these possible sources. Data Type Examples Sales and service data from Salesforce Leads Opportunities Accounts Open service cases (if you use Service Cloud) Revenue and marketing data from Salesforce Past purchase activity (if you use Revenue Cloud) Billing and subscriptions (if you use Revenue Cloud) Website engagement (if you use Marketing Cloud) Depending on your Salesforce setup, some of this data can be available from external sources. Third-party data Inventory and fulfillment status Consumption rates Conference attendance and webinar engagement Customer survey results Social media sentiment Systems and assets data Network information System performance Device information Combining this data means you can create insights that help to predict your potential sales. These insights are just a few examples. Customer satisfaction. Use your past purchase data with your service case, consumption, and customer survey data to assess overall customer happiness with your products and services, which can influence their potential to buy more. Calculated run rate. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with your billing and shipping data to predict your revenue for the year. Likelihood to Close. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with your consumption rate, past purchases, inventory, and seasonal sales trends to make sure you’re engaging with the customers most likely to close the deal. Propensity to buy. Use your Salesforce opportunity data with past purchase history, conference and webinar attendance, and web engagement data to determine a customer’s interest, propensity, and when they’re likely to make their next purchase. Seasonal Sales Trends. Use your past purchase data with your inventory data to determine whether the inventory on hand meets potential demands and whether enough pipeline exists to meet your forecast during a busy season. Task 1: Configure Users for Data Cloud To work with external data in Salesforce, ensure that Data Cloud is set up and provisioned in your Salesforce org. Assign Data Cloud permission sets to any users that need access to Data Cloud. Task 2: Connect and Map Your Data Sources to Data Cloud To bring your data together, connect your data sources in Data Cloud. Data sources are the places that hold your data. Those places can be Salesforce for lead and opportunity data or third-party sources such as Google Storage or Amazon S3 for conference attendance and webinar engagement. Make a list of where your external data comes from and who has access and credentials to that data. How you connect your data to Data Cloud depends on where the data is coming from. To make sure your data source can be connected to Data Cloud, review the available Data Cloud connectors and integrations . Connect and map your sales and service data. Set up a Salesforce connection in Data Cloud . Install a standard data bundle for Sales Cloud and for Service Cloud. To begin the flow of data to Data Cloud, create a data stream . The standard data bundles automatically map Salesforce standard objects to Data Cloud standard data model objects (DMOs). See Sales and Service Data Bundle Mappings . Connect and map your third-party data sources. Configure third-party data sources by using a connector service or a pre-built connector or integration in Data Cloud Setup. You can also connect data using the Bring Your Own Lake (BYOL) Data Federation in Data Cloud. Create a data stream for each of the external data sources. See Data Sources in Data Cloud . For each external source, map your data to DMOs. Make sure you map all fields that are required for your business. For data available in other clouds, explore the connectors and connector services available. If a connector or service isn’t available, manually ingest the data and map your data accordingly. Task 3: Unify Your Data into Profiles Consolidate your data from all your sources into a comprehensive view of your customers and accounts. From that customer view, you can start to learn more about that customer’s buying trends and how they fit into your forecast. Create an identity resolution ruleset . Add match rules . Run the ruleset and then view unified profile results in Profile Explorer. Task 4: Analyze Data with Calculated Insights With all your data now safely in Data Cloud, you’re ready to build the insights that join your data together. For example, create insights that correlate past purchasing patterns from customers with open opportunities, or take a closer look at subscription and web engagement data to determine what upsell or cross-selling opportunities can boost your pipeline. Each insight you create provides better visibility into your pipeline and forecast so you can make forecast adjustments and engage with the right customers to ensure key deals close on time. Knowing exactly where your forecast stands gives you time to update your account strategies to increase your pipeline to ensure you hit your forecast goal. Sales leaders work together to decide which metrics and insights they need and help to identify what data is needed to arrive at that metric. For example, to see the total amount spent by a customer, which can influence future spending habits and your pipeline, you need the customer’s past purchase data. Create the calculated insight . Verify the insight in Data Explorer . To verify the calculation, run or schedule the SQL job. See Enhance Data in Data Cloud in Trailhead to learn more about the types of insights available and how to build your insight expressions. What’s Next Now that your data is connected together, you can bring the power of that data across Salesforce. Here are a few suggested next steps. Segment data into target customer sets. Based on what you find after unifying your data and looking closely at the insights it provides, you can segment your data. For example, create segments for high probability to close or greatest upsell opportunities. These segments can be used to build email campaigns or to create a report or dashboard for sales leaders that can be useful when forecasting. Enrich Sales Cloud records with insights. Provide your sales team access to the calculated insights data on account, contact, or lead records in Sales Cloud. Do more analysis with Tableau. Use Tableau to find useful and actionable insights that can drive business success and create a personalized experience for your customers. Data Cloud, Tableau, and Salesforce 360 apps work together to consolidate your data and create a single customer record. "

Design models on a map by using Territory Planning, available as an add-on product. Then put your models into action by using Sales Territories. Continuous model optimizations help your company make the most of staffing, leadership, and economic changes. Territory Type Territory types help you organize your territories by key characteristics important to your company. Every territory you create has a territory type. Territory types are used for organizing and creating territories only. They don’t appear on territory model hierarchies. Territory Type Priority Specifying and managing territory type priority information helps you choose the appropriate territory type for territories you create or edit. You create your own priority scheme. For example, 001 can indicate that a territory type is the highest priority or the lowest. Make sure that your scheme can scale as you add more territory types. Territory Territories organize groups of accounts, leads, and the Salesforce users who work with them. Territories are created based on territory types. Territory Model A territory model represents a complete territory management system for your company. Modeling lets you create and preview multiple territory structures and different account, lead, and user assignments before you activate the model that works best. Territory Hierarchy The territory hierarchy shows a model’s territory structure and serves as its main interaction point. Start from the hierarchy to create, edit, and delete territories; run assignment rules for territories, and navigate to territory detail pages for more information. From the hierarchy, you can also assign territories to opportunities, run assignment rules at the model level, and activate or archive the model. The forecasts hierarchy for territory forecasts is based on your territory hierarchy in the active territory model. Territory Model State Territory model state indicates whether a territory is in the planning stage, in active use, or archived. You can have only one active territory model at a time. But you can create and maintain multiple models in planning or archived state to use for extra modeling or reference. Some states reflect a territory model’s lifecycle and others indicate errors in processing when states are changed. How Do Permissions for Territories Affect Feature and Data Access?

If a rule has Apply to Child Territories selected, do not assign the rule separately to child territories. From the territory model hierarchy, open the territory where you want to create a rule. On the detail page, in the Assignment Rules Defined in this Territory related list, click New . On the rule edit page, enter a name for the new rule and define selection criteria. If your org has enabled state and country picklists, territory assignment rules using states as a criteria must use contains matching instead of equals matching. Keep in mind that ZIP/postal codes are alphanumeric fields, not number fields, so in a comparison, 9 is “higher” than 80000, for example. If you want the rule to also apply to the current territory’s descendents, select Apply to child territories . If you want the rule to run when a user creates or updates an account, select the Active checkbox. For account updates, these conditions are required for the territory rules to run. If the account is updated in Salesforce, Evaluate this account against territory rules on save is selected and the rule is assigned to a territory in the active territory model. If the account is updated via API, AssignmentRuleHeader is specified. For account inserts, Run territory assignment rules during account inserts in Territory Settings is selected. Click Save to save the rule and return to the territory detail page. Example Rules can work together within territories and child territories. For example, you create a territory called Western States, with child territories Washington, Oregon, and California. From the Western States territory record, you create a rule that assigns accounts in Washington, Oregon, and California to that territory. You apply that rule to child territories and then, from the California territory record, you create a rule that assigns accounts in California to the California territory. For any child territories for the California territory, you don’t have to specify the state in the criteria if you mark the California territory rule as inheritable to child territories. Instead, you can use more specific criteria, such as ZIP code or industry. See Also How Do Permissions for Territories Affect Feature and Data Access?

After you activate another territory model, you must re-create territory forecast types for it. Before you archive a territory model, consider these options. Run the opportunity territory assignment filter, and then take screenshots of the forecasts page. Create a snapshot . The snapshot is not deleted as part of the archiving process. Export your forecasting records, including forecasting items, facts, quotas, and adjustments. When you archive a territory model, Salesforce also deletes data related to sharing and group associations by territory. To retain this data, export the related records before you archive the territory model. While it’s not required, we recommend that you update the territories on opportunity splits and opportunity product splits after you archive the model and activate a new one. Perform this update with the filter-based opportunity territory assignment tool , or reassign territories manually or by using Data Loader. If you’ve enabled deferred group membership calculation , we recommend suspending it to avoid issues with group membership cleanup during territory model archival. You can re-enable deferred group membership calculation after archival is completed. From Setup, enter Territory Models in the Quick Find box, then select Territory Models . Open your active territory model. Click Archive , and then click Archive Territory Model to confirm. The model state changes to Archiving while Salesforce processes your request. When processing is complete, the model state changes to Archived , and you receive a confirmation via email.

If you encounter problems, consider these options. Reduce team member assignments to fewer territories. Or assign team members to higher levels in the territory hierarchy, which can reduce the volume of their assigned territories. Defer group membership calculations during assignment and rules processing. High-volume user assignments to territories While you can assign up to 1,950 users to a territory, these high-volume assignments can affect performance.

Available in: Salesforce Classic for some features and Lightning Experience for all features Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and in Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud A territory can have inherited account assignment rules, meaning that the rules were created somewhere higher in the territory hierarchy and also impact the given territory. A territory can have locally defined account assignment rules, meaning that the rule was associated at the given territory. If a territory doesn't have any inherited or locally defined account assignment rules, then it only contains accounts that were associated manually. If an account matches all inherited and locally defined account assignment rules for multiple territories on the same branch of the hierarchy, the account is assigned to the lowest matching territory. If a territory has multiple locally defined account assignment rules, an account is assigned to the territory only if it matches all locally defined account assignment rules on the territory. When referring to picklist values in your account assignment rules, specify the API name instead of its corresponding value. That way, your account assignment rules reflect any updates to picklist values. For example, you refer to the picklist API name Agriculture_Sales. You change its corresponding value from Agriculture Sales to Agriculture. Account assignment rules now reflect Agriculture. Example Territory A has four rules marked “Apply to child territories“ and is a parent of territory B. Territory B has three rules not marked “Apply to child territories” and is a parent of territory C. Territory C has two rules. If you assign an account that matches all of territory A’s and territory C’s rules but only one of territory B’s rules, the account is assigned to territory C. However, if territory B’s rules are marked ‘Apply to child territories,” the account is assigned only to territory A. "

Learn about key guidelines and considerations when working with splits. Opportunity Splits are available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Opportunity Product Splits are available in Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud User Permissions Needed To create or edit opportunity splits and opportunity product splits for opportunity team members: Edit on opportunities AND Owner of opportunity record or above the owner in the role hierarchy Opportunity Splits Your admin can create custom fields on opportunity splits to help you track splits that you create for team members. The split on the Opportunity Amount field includes one revenue split and one overlay split type. If you want more split types, ask your admin to create them. Your admin specifies which types of splits always total 100%. Look for “must total 100%” in the description of the split. If you don’t see splits on a field, ask your admin to check your field-level security limits. To remove a team member from a split, click Del next to the team member’s name. To edit rich text fields or multiselect picklists, go to each team member’s opportunity split detail page. Your admin can’t include those kinds of fields in the Edit All Opportunity Splits window. When you enter a monetary amount that requires a split percentage with more than two decimal places, the amount is automatically rounded to two places. When an opportunity has overlay splits, changing the opportunity owner without keeping the opportunity team gives the new owner the sum of the previous owner’s split percentage. The new owner also gets the previous owner’s split percentage for the overlay split. You can’t insert or edit certain fields on opportunity splits of a certain opportunity split type, if product split records are set up on the opportunity for that split type. You also can’t delete any opportunity splits belonging to a split type that has product splits included on the opportunity. Opportunity splits don’t roll up to sales territories. In the Salesforce mobile app, the Split Amount field isn’t available, and other opportunity splits fields are read-only. Opportunity Product Splits When an opportunity is transferred to a new owner, the opportunity team can be transferred along with the associated product splits. When you delete all the products on an opportunity and the amount becomes 0, we roll up the changes to opportunity splits. The owner is assigned a 100% split and team members are assigned a 0% split. When you delete all the product splits on an opportunity, we roll up the changes to opportunity splits. The owner is assigned a 100% split and team members are assigned a 0% split. On opportunities with opportunity splits only, when the opportunity amount value is changed to 0, the case is different. Opportunity splits maintain the original percentages. You can’t define product splits on an opportunity for products with both positive and negative amounts if the rollup values in the Percentage field on the related opportunity split record will be outside of the allowed range of 0% to 100%. For example, Sally has an opportunity with two products. She wants to add a product split on Product 2 for her team member Bob. Bob gets 50% of Product 2, which has a negative amount. Sally’s split on the same product is updated to 50%. This split scenario isn’t valid because the opportunity splits for the two reps are outside of the allowed range of 0-100%. When product splits are rolled up to the opportunity splits level, the amounts are limited to two decimal places. While the totals can be more precise with more decimal places, the values sometimes don’t add up to the exact value. For example, an opportunity with two products shows slightly different amounts based on the product split percentages. When you use product splits on revenue split types, you can’t have more than 200 products on an opportunity. Territories on Opportunity Splits and Opportunity Product Splits Assigning a split to a territory doesn’t change the opportunity owner or territory. The current owner and territory still own the opportunity. All splits of one split type for a team member, including the opportunity owner, must have a unique territory. The Split Archived Territory Name, Split Territory ID, Split Territory Name, and Split Territory Description fields are available in the Opportunity and Product Split Report and the Opportunity and Product Split Schedule Report. To distinguish between split territories and opportunity territories in reports, the Territory, Territory Description fields are named Opportunity Territory and Opportunity Territory Description in these reports. Opportunity and Product Split Opportunity and Product Split Schedule Lead Lifetime Opportunities with Partners Opportunities with Competitors Opportunities with Contact Roles Opportunities with Opportunity Teams Opportunity History To see whether splits are associated with archived territory models, add the Archived Territory Name field to the Opportunity and Product Split and Opportunity and Product Split Schedule reports.

Available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with the Sales Cloud User Permissions Needed To enable opportunity splits: Modify All Data Check for mass operations in progress, and make sure that all mass operations are finished. While splits are being enabled, a script temporarily disables validation rules, Apex triggers, and workflows for opportunity team records; mass reassignment of opportunity team members; and mass transfer of accounts and opportunities. If you enable opportunity splits while you’re running a mass operation, such as Mass Transfer or Mass Reassign Team Member, enablement of splits can fail. Resolve inactive currencies. If inactive currencies were active in the past, those currencies are probably still used on some opportunity records. When inactive currency is used on opportunities, the splits enablement process fails. To prevent failure, do one of the following. While splits enablement is in progress, temporarily make inactive currencies active. Delete the opportunities with the inactive currency. This solution works best when you have only a few opportunities with an inactive currency that you don’t need for reporting or historical purposes. Handle automated process users related to opportunities. Opportunities owned by users created during automatic processes such as Apex triggers, workflows, and Marketing Cloud Account Engagement integration block opportunity splits enablement. To prevent the process from failing, transfer ownership of their opportunities to active users. Also, if you have few process users and you don’t need their opportunities for reporting or historical purposes, delete all of their opportunities. Consider enabling opportunity splits at the end of the workday so that the process runs overnight. The process sets up a split on every opportunity, and, depending on the number of opportunity records, it can take several hours. You can still work with Salesforce while the process is ongoing.

Opportunity Splits are available in: Lightning Experience and Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) Opportunity Product Splits are available in Lightning Experience Available in: Performance and Developer Editions and Enterprise and Unlimited Editions with Sales Cloud Setup When you turn on View all opportunities associated with the territory’s child territory , regardless of who owns the opportunity, users in a parent territory have access to the opportunity when the territory is specified on the opportunity split or opportunity product split. When you turn on Use the opportunity’s territory as the default split territory when the default revenue type split is created for the opportunity owner , anytime the default opportunity owner split is created for a revenue type, that split inherits the territory of the parent opportunity. If you use an Apex script to auto-create splits for team members on opportunities, check your script to determine whether you need to update it before you turn on this setting. For example, if your Apex code is written to insert team member revenue type splits with nonzero percentages, your code can fail for opportunities with assigned territories. The reason is that when a team member revenue type split is inserted with a nonzero percentage, we take that percentage from an opportunity owner split in the same territory. If a split doesn’t exist in the same territory for the opportunity owner, the insert of the team member split fails. Update your Apex logic to account for this new behavior by inserting the team member split with the same territory as the territory associated with the default opportunity owner split. First, insert the team member's split at 0%. Then do a bulk update of that split and the opportunity owner's split to update all splits to the percentages that you want. Territory Models and Territories When you archive a territory model, users without the ManageTerritories permission can’t access the territories in that model. Split records retain the association with the territories in an archived territory model. While this association doesn’t cause errors, we recommend reassigning the records to territories in an active territory model. You can't delete territory models that have territories with associated opportunity splits or opportunity product splits. Remove the territory associations before you delete the territory models, or reassign the splits to other active territories. To delete an archived territory model, remove the territory associations or reassign the splits to a territory in an active territory model. You can reassign split records to different territories several ways. Use the filter-based opportunity territory assignment tool that’s available in Territory Settings in Setup (recommended). Users can manually reassign the territories. Use Data Loader to import updated records. Fields and Reports The default field label in the multi-line layout on the opportunity split and opportunity product split object is Territory. To see reports of splits by territory, use the Split Archived Territory Name, Split Territory ID, Split Territory Name, and Split Territory Description fields on the Opportunity and Product Split Report and the Opportunity and Product Split Schedule Report. To see whether splits are associated with archived territory models, add the Archived Territory Name field to the Opportunity and Product Split and Opportunity and Product Split Schedule Reports. "

To designate your corporate currency, from Setup, enter Manage Currencies in the Quick Find box, then select Manage Currencies , and then click Change Corporate . To activate more currencies for your organization, click New in the Active Currencies related list. To use dated exchange rates, enable advanced currency management. Set conversion rates for new currencies. If you have enabled advanced currency management, see Editing Dated Exchange Rates . International organizations can use multiple currencies in opportunities, forecasts, reports, quotes, and other currency fields. The administrator sets the “corporate currency,” which reflects the currency of the corporate headquarters. The administrator also maintains the list of active currencies and their conversion rates relative to the corporate currency. The active currencies represent the countries in which the organization does business. Only active currencies can be used in currency amount fields. Each user has a personal currency, which is used as the default currency in quotas, opportunities, quotes, and reports. Users can also create opportunities and enter amounts using other active currencies. All standard and custom object records with currency fields have a field that specifies the currency to use for all amount fields in that record. (Click Edit to display this editable Currency field on a record.) For example, you can set the Account Currency to “USD-U.S. Dollars” so that the Annual Revenue shows in dollars for one of your American accounts. All currency amounts are displayed in the default currency of the record. Administrators can choose whether to also display, in parentheses, the user’s personal currency if it is different from the currency of the record. When you change the default currency of a record, currency amounts are not converted. They display the new currency code. Note If your organization uses advanced currency management , the opportunity close date determines which conversion rate to use when displaying currency amounts. Amounts in reports are shown in their original currencies, but can be displayed in any active currency. You can change the currency used for report totals by selecting a currency from Show Currencies . The default value is your personal currency. For any amount, you can choose to display the Converted column—for example, Annual Revenue Converted —which shows amounts in the currency you select. Custom formula fields are not tied to any particular currency. If the result of a formula field is a currency amount, it displays in the currency of the associated record. This rule is also true for cross-object formulas that reference merge fields with different currencies, and formulas in workflow rules and approval processes. However, workflow rules and approval processes that use filters instead of formulas convert all currency values to the corporate currency. If currency fields are referenced in Apex, you can’t disable multiple currencies for your organization. For example, if Apex code references the Account Currency field (represented as CurrencyIsoCode in the code), you can’t disable multiple currencies. Enable Multiple Currencies Before your organization can use multiple currencies, the feature must be turned on. Considerations for Enabling Multiple Currencies Enabling multiple currencies introduces permanent changes in your organization. Before proceeding, be aware of these implications to ensure a smooth transition for your organization. Activate and Deactivate Currencies For orgs with multiple currencies, specify which currencies are supported by activating or deactivating currencies. About Advanced Currency Management Advanced currency management allows you to manage dated exchange rates within opportunities using Salesforce.

Before proceeding, be aware of these implications to ensure a smooth transition for your organization. Available in: Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Group, Starter, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, Developer, and Database.com Editions After enabled, multiple currencies can’t be disabled for your organization. If multiple currencies is enabled, field-to-field filters in reports don't support currency fields, like amount. Upon enablement, existing records are stamped with a default currency code that you provide in your enablement request. For example, if your organization contains records using USD and EUR, switch them all to the same default currency before enablement. Support for this type of conversion is also available as a Salesforce paid implementation service. Standard and custom objects, such as Account, Lead, Case, Opportunities, Opportunity Products, Opportunity Product Schedules, and Campaign Opportunities, have currency fields that support multiple currencies. Reports related to these objects and fields also support multiple currencies. By default, page layouts for these objects have multi-currency-compatible fields in which you can specify the currency for the record. Typically, these fields are available only when creating a record or editing an existing record. The selected currency is used for the primary amount field. When you create and test a package, the temporary build org has only USD configured. Using a currency code other than USD for testing results in an error After enablement, the number of decimal places defined in a custom currency field is ignored. Instead set decimal places per currency through Manage Currencies in Setup. After enablement, the primary currency displays as usual and, optionally, a secondary currency amount appears in parentheses. The primary currency is typically the default corporate currency, unless it’s overridden at the record level. The amount shown in parentheses is the user’s personal default currency, calculated based on the conversion rate settings defined in your organization. To control whether the converted currency amount appears, enable or disable parenthetical currency conversion from the Manage Currencies page. In reports, the primary currency reflects either the default corporate currency or the currency selected for the record. The secondary currency reflects the personal default currency of the user running the report, or the currency specified in the report criteria. Users can specify a personal default currency on their personal information page. If parenthetical currency conversion is enabled, the personal default currency displays as the secondary currency amount (converted amount). Changing the personal default currency updates the converted amount in real time. After a currency is added to an organization’s list of supported currencies, it can’t be deleted from the administrator’s list of currencies, even when it’s deactivated. The presence of inactive currencies in the administrator’s list is a cosmetic issue that doesn’t affect end users. A deactivated currency isn’t visible to end users, but remains visible to administrators. Salesforce recommends that you keep this issue in mind during testing and use only those currencies that you eventually plan to use in your organization. After enablement, all currency fields display the ISO code of the currency before the amount. For example, $100 displays as USD 100. Note If you have only one currency in your multi-currency organization, you can set a preference to display currency symbols instead of ISO codes. To display currency symbols, search Setup for User Interface , and then select Show currency symbols instead of ISO codes in the Currency Display Settings section of the User Interface settings page. If you later enable more currencies in your organization, ISO codes display, and this preference is no longer available. This preference applies only in the standard Salesforce user interface. By default, all converted amounts in your organization rely on the current conversion rates defined for your organization. Conversion rates must be set and updated manually. Changing the exchange rate automatically updates converted amounts on all records, including on closed opportunities. You can opt to use dated exchange rates by using advanced currency management to track historical exchange rates. Advanced currency management allows you to maintain a list of exchange rates by date range. Converted currency amounts on opportunities display based on the specified Close Date, regardless of the opportunity stage. If the Close Date changes to a different exchange rate period, changing the Close Date impacts converted amounts. Note Dated exchange rates aren’t used in forecasting, currency fields in other objects, or currency fields in other types of reports.

Only active currencies can be entered in opportunities, forecasts, and other items. Once you activate a currency, you can never permanently delete it. Inactive currencies are currencies that your org no longer uses. You can have existing records that use inactive currencies, but you can’t enter new amounts that use inactive currencies. To activate new currencies: From Setup, enter Manage Currencies in the Quick Find box, then select Manage Currencies . Click New in the Active Currencies related list. Select a currency. Currencies are alphabetized using their ISO currency code. Enter the conversion rate relative to your corporate currency. Specify the number of decimal places to display for amounts in this currency. Click Save . To activate a currency from the list of inactive currencies, click Activate next to the currency. To deactivate a currency, click Deactivate next to the currency. You can’t deactivate the corporate currency. Deactivating a currency does not alter amounts in items that use that currency. However, you can no longer enter new amounts using the inactive currency. Note Deactivating a currency that is set as a user’s personal currency automatically resets the user’s currency to the corporate currency.

Dated exchange rates allow you to map a conversion rate to a specific date range. and User Permissions Available in: both Salesforce Classic (not available in all orgs) and Lightning Experience Available in: Group, Professional, Enterprise, Performance, Unlimited, and Developer Editions User Permissions Needed To enable advanced currency management: Customize Application To view currencies: View Setup and Configuration To change currencies: Customize Application For example, the exchange rate on January 1 was 1 USD to 1.39 AUD, but on February 1, it changed to 1 USD to 1.42 AUD. Your opportunities that closed between January 1 and February 1 use the first exchange rate (1 = 1.39), while opportunities that closed after February 1 used the second exchange rate (1 = 1.42). Dated exchange rates are defined using a start date and a conversion rate. Each rate is in effect until either the end of time or the day before the next start date for that currency. The time between one start date and the next start date is called the exchange rate date range. These ranges can be as small as a day and as large as all time. To enable or disable advanced currency management, see Enabling or Disabling Advanced Currency Management . When advanced currency management is first enabled, your existing exchange rates automatically become the first set of dated exchange rates. These rates are valid for all time, until you define another set of exchange rates. If you disable advanced currency management, all currency conversions use the static conversion rate. See Edit Conversion Rates . Advanced Currency Management Considerations Dated exchange rates are used for opportunities, opportunity products, opportunity product schedules, campaign opportunity fields, opportunity splits, and reports related to these objects and fields. Dated exchange rates are not used in forecasting, currency fields in other objects, or currency fields in other types of reports. Dated exchange rates are also not used when calculating formula fields with a formula return type of “Currency.” Organizations with advanced currency management support roll-up summary fields between two advanced currency management objects. For example, roll-up summary fields are supported from an opportunity line item object to its opportunity object, because both are advanced currency management enabled. However, if you enable advanced currency management, you can’t create roll-up summary fields that calculate currency on the opportunity object rolling up to the account object. You also can’t filter on the opportunity currency field on the account object. All existing currency-related roll-up summary fields on the opportunity object that summarize objects that don’t support dated exchange rates are disabled and their values are no longer calculated. If your organization enables advanced currency management, delete any currency roll-up summary fields using opportunities and accounts or opportunities and custom objects. Campaign opportunity fields use dated exchange rates when calculating the amount in the campaign currency. However, they don’t use dated exchange rates when converting those amounts to the user currency. Cross-object formulas always use the static conversion rate for currency conversion. If advanced currency management is enabled, you can't bind Visualforce pages that use <apex:inputField> or <apex:outputField> components to currency fields that support advanced currency management.

A comma in the label for a field value is OK. Editing and Validation The record type and owner fields aren’t editable in the Key Fields panel. To transfer ownership, users must use the Details tab. To change the record type, they must use the Change Record Type action. If a path exists for a record type that you delete, the path is also deleted. You can’t use the page layout to require different fields in different steps. However, you can set up validation rules based on a path step. Validation messages appear as page-level messages, even when you configure the rules to display them near the fields. If the Opportunity Stage field is in use in field dependencies, all Stage values are visible when selecting the last stage Closed, instead of showing only Closed/Won and Closed/Lost options. Setup in Orgs with Many Objects, Record Types, and Picklists If your org has a large combination of objects, record types, and picklists, path creation can take a couple of minutes. Translation To translate Guidance for Success content, use the Path Step Rich Text component in Translation Workbench. Packages You can’t include images in path packages. You can’t package custom values in standard picklist fields on paths. Leads, Opportunities, and Accounts Lead Paths If you create a path for leads, we recommend making Unqualified status the first step. Opportunity Stage Durations in Paths and Reports Opportunity stage durations are displayed differently in paths and reports. In paths, durations are rounded up to the nearest day; a duration of a minute is still displayed as 1 day. In reports, durations aren’t rounded up; a duration of less than 24 hours is displayed as 0 days. Opportunity stage durations are totaled differently in paths and reports. In reports, the stage duration is the total number of days since the time that the opportunity entered the current stage to the time it’s moved to the next stage. For example, an opportunity is moved into Proposal stage, stays there for 2 days, and then moves into Negotiation. Later it’s moved back into Proposal and stays there for 3 days. Although the opportunity moves back to the Proposal stage, the stage duration in reports only shows the stage duration between the first two stages, which is 2 days. In paths, the stage duration is the total number of days that the opportunity spends in a stage. For example, in the same scenario, both times that the opportunity is in the Proposal stage are totaled, for a stage duration of 5 days. Opportunity stage durations aren’t shown in paths in Experience Cloud sites. Business Accounts Versus Person Accounts If person accounts are enabled, the account record type selected determines whether a path is for business accounts or person accounts.

Turn on Einstein and we take care of the rest. and User Permissions Available in: Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience Available in: Enterprise, Performance, and Unlimited Editions User Permissions Needed To turn on Einstein Opportunity Scoring For Everyone: Customize Application AND Modify All Data Note For customers without the Sales Cloud Einstein license, Einstein Opportunity Scoring is available on a rolling basis starting in the Spring ’20 release. For details about timing and eligibility, contact your Salesforce account executive. Opportunity scores are available in both Salesforce Classic and Lightning Experience, but you have to turn on Einstein in Lightning Experience. When you don’t have any Sales Cloud Einstein licenses, Einstein Opportunity Scoring isn’t available in sandbox or for Salesforce Government Cloud customers. If you’re missing the option to enable Einstein Opportunity Scoring, contact Salesforce Customer Support. To get started with Einstein, follow the in-app prompts. Or, from Setup in Lightning Experience, enter Assisted Setup in the Quick Find. Then, select Assisted Setup under Einstein Sales. Confirm that you understand what happens when you turn on Einstein. Click Turn It On . If needed, review and accept the terms. Here’s what happens next. We analyze your teams’ past opportunities to build a scoring model. Building a model can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days, depending on how much data you have. The model, which is refreshed at regular intervals, is used to generate scores. We add the Score field to your standard and custom opportunity page layouts. If you use full view as your default record view, scores don’t always appear in the layout’s first section. We add the Opportunity Score field to the Recently Viewed list view. Add the field to public opportunity list views and ask your sales teams to add it to their own opportunity list views. We assign the Sales Cloud Einstein For Everyone permission set to all users who have a Salesforce user license. Users see scores after they’re generated. You can remove access for individual users through the permission set. We create a Sales Insights Integration user and assign it to a user profile of the same name. Although you see the user and profile listed in your org, they’re used only behind the scenes. Tip If you don’t see scores a few days after turning on Einstein, review information about how Einstein scores your opportunities. If you still need help, contact Salesforce Customer Support for assistance. To customize the scoring model, go to the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page and click Review Settings . Read the introduction, and then click Next . Choose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity records or only a subset when building the scoring model. Then, click Next . If needed, define the conditions, and click Next . Choose whether to have Einstein consider all opportunity custom fields when building the scoring model. Then, click Next . If needed, deselect the fields you want Einstein to ignore, and click Next . Review your settings. Then, click Start to begin the scoring process. It can take up to 48 hours to analyze your data, build a new scoring model, and update scores. To check the status, return to the Einstein Opportunity Scoring setup page.
